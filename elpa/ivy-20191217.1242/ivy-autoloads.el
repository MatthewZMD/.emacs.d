(autoload 'ivy-resume "ivy" "\
Resume the last completion session.

\(fn)" t nil)

(autoload 'ivy-read "ivy" "\
Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.

PROMPT is a string, normally ending in a colon and a space.
`ivy-count-format' is prepended to PROMPT during completion.

COLLECTION is either a list of strings, a function, an alist, or
a hash table, supplied for `minibuffer-completion-table'.

PREDICATE is applied to filter out the COLLECTION immediately.
This argument is for compatibility with `completing-read'.

When REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, only members of COLLECTION can be
selected.

If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, then insert that input in the
minibuffer initially.

HISTORY is a name of a variable to hold the completion session
history.

KEYMAP is composed with `ivy-minibuffer-map'.

PRESELECT, when non-nil, determines which one of the candidates
matching INITIAL-INPUT to select initially.  An integer stands
for the position of the desired candidate in the collection,
counting from zero.  Otherwise, use the first occurrence of
PRESELECT in the collection.  Comparison is first done with
`equal'.  If that fails, and when applicable, match PRESELECT as
a regular expression.

DEF is for compatibility with `completing-read'.

UPDATE-FN is called each time the candidate list is re-displayed.

When SORT is non-nil, `ivy-sort-functions-alist' determines how
to sort candidates before displaying them.

ACTION is a function to call after selecting a candidate.
It takes one argument, the selected candidate. If COLLECTION is
an alist, the argument is a cons cell, otherwise it's a string.

MULTI-ACTION, when non-nil, is called instead of ACTION when
there are marked candidates. It takes the list of candidates as
its only argument. When it's nil, ACTION is called on each marked
candidate.

UNWIND is a function of no arguments to call before exiting.

RE-BUILDER is a function transforming input text into a regex
pattern.

MATCHER is a function which can override how candidates are
filtered based on user input.  It takes a regex pattern and a
list of candidates, and returns the list of matching candidates.

DYNAMIC-COLLECTION is a boolean specifying whether the list of
candidates is updated after each input by calling COLLECTION.

EXTRA-PROPS can be used to store collection-specific
session-specific data.

CALLER is a symbol to uniquely identify the caller to `ivy-read'.
It is used, along with COLLECTION, to determine which
customizations apply to the current completion session.

(autoload 'ivy-completing-read "ivy" "\
Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.

This interface conforms to `completing-read' and can be used for
`completing-read-function'.

PROMPT is a string that normally ends in a colon and a space.
COLLECTION is either a list of strings, an alist, an obarray, or a hash table.
PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of COLLECTION.
REQUIRE-MATCH is a boolean value or a symbol.  See `completing-read'.
INITIAL-INPUT is a string inserted into the minibuffer initially.
HISTORY is a list of previously selected inputs.
DEF is the default value.
INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is currently ignored.
