;;; Commentary:

;; `memoize' accepts a symbol or a function. When given a symbol, the
;; symbol's function definition is memoized and installed overtop of
;; the original function definition. When given a function, it returns
;; a memoized version of that function.

;;     (memoize 'my-expensive-function)

;; `defmemoize' defines a memoized function directly, behaving just
;; like `defun'.

;;     (defmemoize my-expensive-function (n)
;;       (if (zerop n)
;;           1
;;         (* n (my-expensive-function (1- n)))))

;; Memoizing an interactive function will render that function
;; non-interactive. It would be easy to fix this problem when it comes
;; to non-byte-compiled functions, but recovering the interactive
;; definition from a byte-compiled function is more complex than I
;; care to deal with. Besides, interactive functions are always used
;; for their side effects anyway.

;; There's no way to memoize nil returns, but why would your expensive
;; functions do all that work just to return nil? :-)

;; Memoization takes up memory, which should be freed at some point.
;; Because of this, all memoization has a timeout from when the last
;; access was. The default timeout is set by
;; `memoize-default-timeout'.  It can be overridden by using the
;; `memoize' function, but the `defmemoize' macro will always just use
;; the default timeout.

;; If you wait to byte-compile the function until *after* it is
;; memoized then the function and memoization wrapper both get
;; compiled at once, so there's no special reason to do them
;; separately. But there really isn't much advantage to compiling the
;; memoization wrapper anyway.

expire, which will cause a memory leak, but may be acceptable for
very careful uses.")

will get garbage collected."
  ;; We need 3 tables here to properly garbage collect. First is the
  ;; table for the memoization itself, `memoization-table'. It holds a
  ;; cons of the content hash and the function arguments.
  ;;
  ;; Buffer contents change often, though, so we want these entries to
  ;; be automatically garbage collected when the buffer changes or the
  ;; buffer goes away. To keep the entries around, we need to tie the
  ;; content hash to the buffer, so that the content hash string
  ;; doesn't go away until the buffer does. We do that with the

  ;; But even if the buffer content does change, we need to expire the
  ;; memoization entries for that particular buffer content. So we
  ;; have a `contents-to-memoization-table' that we use to tie the
  ;; content hash to the memoization conses used as keys in the
  ;; `memoization-table'.
  ;;
  ;; If a buffer's value changes, we make sure the next time we put a
  ;; new value at the `buffer-to-contents-table', which causes the
