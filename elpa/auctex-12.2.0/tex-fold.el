;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides support for hiding and unhiding TeX, LaTeX,
;; ConTeXt, Texinfo and similar macros and environments inside of
;; AUCTeX.
;;
;; Caveats:
;;
;; The display string of content which should display part of itself
;; is made by copying the text from the buffer together with its text
;; properties.  If fontification has not happened when this is done
;; (e.g. because of lazy or just-in-time font locking) the intended
;; fontification will not show up.  Maybe this could be improved by
;; using some sort of "lazy folding" or refreshing the window upon
;; scrolling.  As a workaround fontification of the whole buffer
;; currently is forced before folding it.

  "List of replacement specifiers and macros to fold.

The first element of each item can be a string, an integer or a
function symbol.  The second element is a list of macros two fold
without the leading backslash.

If the first element is a string, it will be used as a display
replacement for the whole macro.  Numbers in braces, brackets,
parens or angle brackets will be replaced by the respective macro
argument.  For example \"{1}\" will be replaced by the first
mandatory argument of the macro.  One can also define
alternatives within the specifier which are used if an argument
is not found.  Alternatives are separated by \"||\".  They are
most useful with optional arguments.  As an example, the default
specifier for \\item is \"[1]:||*\" which means that if there is
an optional argument, its value is shown followed by a colon.  If
there is no optional argument, only an asterisk is used as the
display string.

If the first element is an integer, the macro will be replaced by
the respective macro argument.

If the first element is a function symbol, the function will be
called with all mandatory arguments of the macro and the result
of the function call will be used as a replacement for the macro.

Setting this variable does not take effect immediately.  Use
Customize or reset the mode."
