;;; Commentary:

;; This package is written for use in emacs lisp programs, where the
;; user is prompted for a string of the form:
;;
;;   FOO,BAR,BAZ
;;
;; where FOO, BAR, and BAZ are elements of some table.  The function
;; `multi-prompt' is a replacement `completing-read' that will allow
;; the user to enter a string like the above, yet get completion on
;; all FOO, BAR, and BAZ.

;;; Code:

(defvar multi-prompt-found nil
  "List of entries currently added during a `multi-prompt'.")

		     unique prompt table
		     &optional mp-predicate require-match initial history)

The first argument SEPARATOR should be the string (of length 1) to
separate the elements in the list.  The second argument UNIQUE should
be non-nil, if each element must be unique.  The remaining elements
are the arguments to `completing-read'.  See that."

;;; Support for key=value completion

;; The following code was ripped out of crm.el
;; (completing-read-multiple) and extended to support comma-separated
;; key=value lists.  The code is separate from the code above.

;; WARNING: This obviously relies on internals of crm.el and
;; minibuffer.el and will therefore have to be adapted if these
;; change.

;; TODO: How to support stuff like "caption={[one]two}" or
;; "morekeywords={one,three,five}"?

`all-completions'.  A value of lambda specifes a test for an exact match.
