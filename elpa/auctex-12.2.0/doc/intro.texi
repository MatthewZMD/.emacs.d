@ifset rawfile
This file gives a brief overview of what @AUCTeX{} is.  It is
@strong{not} an attempt to document @AUCTeX{}.  Real documentation for
@AUCTeX{} is available in the manual, which should be available as an
info file after installation.
@end ifset

@AUCTeX{} is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for @TeX{}, @LaTeX{}, @ConTeXt{}, Texinfo, and
doc@TeX{} using Emacs.

It supports you in the insertion of macros, environments, and sectioning
commands by providing completion alternatives and prompting for
parameters.  It automatically indents your text as you type it and lets
you format a whole file at once.  The outlining and folding facilities
provide you with a focused and clean view of your text.

@AUCTeX{} lets you process your source files by running @TeX{} and
related tools (such as output filters, post processors for generating
indices and bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  @AUCTeX{}
lets you browse through the errors @TeX{} reported, while it moves the
cursor directly to the reported error, and displays some documentation
for that particular error.  This will even work when the document is
spread over several files.

One component of @AUCTeX{} that @LaTeX{} users will find attractive is
@previewlatex{}, a combination of folding and in-source previewing
that provides true ``What You See Is What You Get'' experience in your
sourcebuffer, while letting you retain full control.

More detailed information about the features and usage of @AUCTeX{} can
be found in the
@ifset rawfile
@AUCTeX{} manual.  You can access it from within Emacs by typing
@kbd{C-h i d m auctex @key{RET}}.  If you prefer the standalone info
reader, issue the command @code{info auctex} in a terminal.
