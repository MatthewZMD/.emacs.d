(This text is stolen from the Texinfo manual, Edition 4.0).

The programs currently being distributed that relate to @previewlatex{}
include lisp files for Emacs and style files for @LaTeX{}.  These
programs are @dfn{free}; this means that everyone is free to use them
and free to redistribute them on a free basis.  The @previewlatex{}
related programs are not in the public domain; they are copyrighted and
there are restrictions on their distribution, but these restrictions are
designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want
to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further
sharing any version of these programs that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of the programs that relate to @previewlatex{}, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the @previewlatex{} related programs, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must tell them their
rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to
@previewlatex{}.  If these programs are modified by someone else and
passed on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not
what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on our reputation.

The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently being
distributed that relate to @previewlatex{} are found in the General Public
Licenses that accompany them.
