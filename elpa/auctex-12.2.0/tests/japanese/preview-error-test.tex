% Please check that all preview images in this buffer come out at the
% correct position.  I.e., preview images should hide each \section
% command.
% When done, type C-M-c or M-x exit-recursive-edit.
%
% If the image is at the beginning of the line and "\section{xxx}" is
% placed far rightward of the image, then the result should be considered
% as fail.
% In addition, if the image covers "\section{xxx}" only partially, the
% result should be considered as fail, too.
% On the contrary, if the text shown in the image is garbled while the
% position of the image is correct, then the result should be considered as
% OK.  That means that your ghostscript is not configured to handle
% Japanese postscript font names correctly and the functionality of
% preview-latex is just fine.
