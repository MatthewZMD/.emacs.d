;;; Commentary:

;; Set up AUCTeX for editing French text.  In particular for commands
;; provided by the `francais' option of the `babel' LaTeX package.  As
;; this is equivalent to the `frenchb' option, this file only loads
;; `frenchb.el'.

;;; Code:

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "francais"
 (lambda ()
   (TeX-run-style-hooks "frenchb"))
 LaTeX-dialect)

;;; francais.el ends here
