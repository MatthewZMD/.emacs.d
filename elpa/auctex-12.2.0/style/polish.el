;; Set up AUCTeX for editing Polish text in connection with the
;; `polish' babel option.

;;; Code:

(defvar LaTeX-polish-mode-syntax-table
  (copy-syntax-table LaTeX-mode-syntax-table)
  "Syntax table used in LaTeX mode when using `polish.sty'.")

(modify-syntax-entry ?\" "w" LaTeX-polish-mode-syntax-table)

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "polish"
 (lambda ()
   (set-syntax-table LaTeX-polish-mode-syntax-table)
   (unless (eq (car TeX-quote-language) 'override)
     (setq TeX-quote-language `("polish" "\"`" "\"'" ,TeX-quote-after-quote)))
   ;; Fontification of quotation marks.
