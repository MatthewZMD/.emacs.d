;;; Commentary:

;; This is a propser (http://prosper.sourceforge.net/) style file for
;; AUCTeX.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; For this file to work you need to have a working installation of
;; AucTeX. After that installtion is simple. Put this file into one of
;; the directories specified in `TeX-style-path', with the name
;; "style" rather than "auto" as it might get over written in the
;; latter.
;;
;; Then stick the current for into your .emacs
;; (eval-after-load "latex"
;;   '(add-to-list 'LaTeX-style-list '("prosper")))
;;
;;
;; And that should be it. You check whether it's worked or not by
;; opening a prosper document, and trying `LaTeX-environment'. "slide"
;; should be available by tab completion and it should ask you about
;; overlays.
;;
;; The environment "prosper" should be inserted immediately after the
;; document environment.  It will prompt you for options available
;; under prosper and create a skeleton document.

;;; Bugs:
;;
;; Currently the documentclass expansion doesn't work, unless you
;; enter a documentclass line to let auctex know which style files to
;; load. Then delete this and do it again. Not good. I know no way
;; around this.

;;; Code:

;; Constants:


;; This is partly working now, and it a little neater than it
;; was. The main problem is that the redefinition of "documentclass"
;; does not happen until its all too late, so that stuff never
;; happens correctly. This is easy enough to fix by fiddling with
;; auctex. I shall have to download the latest version, and see if
;; its already been fixed.
