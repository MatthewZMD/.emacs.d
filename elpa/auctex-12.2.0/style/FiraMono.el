		  (keywords class))

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "FiraMono"
 (lambda ()

   ;; `textcomp' is always loaded:
   (TeX-run-style-hooks "textcomp")

   ;; If package option `type1' is given, load `fontaxes':
   (when (LaTeX-provided-package-options-member "FiraMono" "type1")
     (TeX-run-style-hooks "fontaxes"))

   ;; Macros:
   (TeX-add-symbols
    '("sufigures"        -1)
