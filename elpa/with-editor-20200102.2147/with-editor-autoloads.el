This works in `shell-mode', `term-mode' and `eshell-mode'.

Teach `shell-command' to use current Emacs instance as editor.

Teach `shell-command', and all commands that ultimately call that
command, to use the current Emacs instance as editor by executing
\"EDITOR=CLIENT COMMAND&\" instead of just \"COMMAND&\".

CLIENT is automatically generated; EDITOR=CLIENT instructs
COMMAND to use to the current Emacs instance as \"the editor\",
assuming no other variable overrides the effect of \"$EDITOR\".
CLIENT may be the path to an appropriate emacsclient executable
with arguments, or a script which also works over Tramp.

Alternatively you can use the `with-editor-async-shell-command',
which also allows the use of another variable instead of
\"EDITOR\".

Like `async-shell-command' but with `$EDITOR' set.

Execute string \"ENVVAR=CLIENT COMMAND\" in an inferior shell;
display output, if any.  With a prefix argument prompt for an
environment variable, otherwise the default \"EDITOR\" variable
is used.  With a negative prefix argument additionally insert
the COMMAND's output at point.

CLIENT is automatically generated; ENVVAR=CLIENT instructs
COMMAND to use to the current Emacs instance as \"the editor\",
