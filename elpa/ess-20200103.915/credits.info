The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of many
contributors, dating back to 1989 where Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote
S-mode to edit S and Splus files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike
Meyer added features, creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made
further contributions, creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith
provided significant enhancements to allow for powerful process
interaction.

   John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added functions to submit jobs, review listing and log files,
and produce basic views of a dataset, thus creating a SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.

   In 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode to support XEmacs.  Together
with extensions written by Martin Maechler, this became version 4.7 and
supported S, Splus, and R. In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to work
with XEmacs.

   In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.  Richard M. Heiberger designed the inferior mode
for interactive SAS and SAS-mode was further integrated into ESS. Thomas
Lumley's Stata mode, written around 1996, was also folded into ESS. More
changes were made to support additional statistical languages,
particularly XLispStat.

   ESS initially worked only with Unix statistics packages that used
standard-input and standard-output for both the command-line interface
and batch processing.  ESS could not communicate with statistical
packages that did not use this protocol.  This changed in 1998 when
Brian Ripley demonstrated use of the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
protocol with ESS. Heiberger then used DDE to provide interactive
interfaces for Windows versions of Splus.  In 1999, Rodney A. Sparapani
and Heiberger implemented SAS batch for ESS relying on files, rather
than standard-input/standard-output, for Unix, Windows and Mac.  In
2001, Sparapani added BUGS batch file processing to ESS for Unix and
Windows.
