;;; History:

;; This file was originally written by Sebastian Luque in 2004. It was
;; completely rewritten in 2019 and then merged into ess-r-mode as
;; part of contributing ESS to GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This file used to have support for listing packages and a few other
;; misc functions. That is now in ess-r-mode. This file is provided
;; only so that users who have (require 'ess-rutils) in their init
;; files don't encounter errors when they update ESS.

;;; Code:

(provide 'ess-rutils)
