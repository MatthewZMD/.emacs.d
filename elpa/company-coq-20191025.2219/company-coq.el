;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package includes a collection of company-mode backends for
;; Proof-General's Coq mode, and many useful extensions to Proof-General.
;;
;; See https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq/ for a detailed description,

;;; History:
;;
;; 2016-02-28 — Show input hints for Unicode and prettified symbols
;; 2016-02-28 — Prettify symbols in notation strings and code blocks
;; 2016-02-07 — Support for changing [Require]s to use fully qualified names
;; 2016-02-02 — Preserve names by inserting intros when extracting a lemma
;; 2016-01-31 — Fall back to regular autocompletion in comments (except in code blocks)
;; 2016-01-26 — Detect and display subscripts: a1 → a₁ and a__n → aₙ
;; 2016-01-20 — First stable release (~600 commits)

;; Technical notes
;; ===============
;;
;; Sending  commands to  the prover  when it's  already busy  breaks everything.
;; 'proof-shell-handle-delayed-output-hook is  a good  place to  reload symbols,
;; except when an error occurs (in that case the hook runs before all output has
;; been processed.
;;
;; This problem is solved by refusing  to communicate with the prover, unless it
;; is reported as available. When it isn't, the interaction is either abandonned
;; (that's what happens  with documentation, and with completion  if the symbols
;; aren't available yet)) or delayed using  an idle timer (reload; in fact, this
;; one is always wrapped in an idle  timer). To prevent loops due to idle timers
;; firing in succession, reloads are only attempted once.
;;
;; The current implementation uses two hooks:
;;  * 'proof-shell-insert-hook
;;      In this one we check the input to see if it might introduce new symbols
;;      (e.g. [Require …])
;;  * 'proof-shell-handle-delayed-output-hook
;;      In this one we parse the output to see if it suggests that new symbols
;;      have been introduced (e.g. [… defined])
;;
;; Since these  two hooks are  called into even for  commands issued by  our own
;; code, we only execute their body if  we are not currently already waiting for
;; an answer from the prover (company-coq-talking-to-prover).
