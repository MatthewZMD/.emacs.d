1.1 Summary
===========

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project
planning with a fast and effective plain-text markup language.  It also
is an authoring system with unique support for literate programming and
reproducible research.

   Org is implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to
keep the content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created
with a built-in table editor.  Plain text URL-like links connect to
websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related
to the projects.

   Org develops organizational tasks around notes files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Project planning and
task management make use of metadata which is part of an outline node.
Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted in queries and
create dynamic _agenda views_ that also integrate the Emacs calendar and
diary.  Org can be used to implement many different project planning
schemes, such as David Allen’s GTD system.

   Org files can serve as a single source authoring system with export
to many different formats such as HTML, LaTeX, Open Document, and
Markdown.  New export backends can be derived from existing ones, or
defined from scratch.

   Org files can include source code blocks, which makes Org uniquely
suited for authoring technical documents with code examples.  Org source
code blocks are fully functional; they can be evaluated in place and
their results can be captured in the file.  This makes it possible to
create a single file reproducible research compendium.

   Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when needed.
Org is a toolbox.  Many users actually run only a—very personal—fraction
of Org’s capabilities, and know that there is more whenever they need
it.

   All of this is achieved with strictly plain text files, the most
portable and future-proof file format.  Org runs in Emacs.  Emacs is one
of the most widely ported programs, so that Org mode is available on
every major platform.

   There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest version
of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked questions
(FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
<https://orgmode.org>.

   An earlier version (7.3) of this manual is available as a paperback
book from Network Theory Ltd.

1.2 Installation
================

Org is included in all recent distributions of GNU Emacs, so you
probably do not need to install it.  Most users will simply activate Org
and begin exploring its many features.

   If, for one reason or another, you want to install Org on top of this
pre-packaged version, there are three ways to do it:

   • by using the Emacs package system;
   • by downloading Org as an archive; or
   • by using Org’s git repository.

   We *strongly recommend* sticking to a single installation method.

Using Emacs packaging system
----------------------------

Recent Emacs distributions include a packaging system which lets you
install Elisp libraries.  You can install Org with ‘M-x package-install
<RET> org’.

     Important: You need to do this in a session where no ‘.org’ file
     has been visited, i.e., where no Org built-in function have been
     loaded.  Otherwise autoload Org functions will mess up the
     installation.

   Then, to make sure your Org configuration is taken into account,
initialize the package system with ‘(package-initialize)’ in your Emacs
init file before setting any Org option.  If you want to use Org’s
package repository, check out the Org ELPA page
(https://orgmode.org/elpa.html).

Downloading Org as an archive
-----------------------------

You can download Org latest release from Org’s website
(https://orgmode.org/).  In this case, make sure you set the load-path
correctly in your Emacs init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")

   The downloaded archive contains contributed libraries that are not
included in Emacs.  If you want to use them, add the ‘contrib/’
directory to your load-path:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t)

   Optionally, you can compile the files and/or install them in your
system.  Run ‘make help’ to list compilation and installation options.

Using Org’s git repository
--------------------------

You can clone Org’s repository and install Org like this:

     $ cd ~/src/
     $ git clone git@code.orgmode.org:bzg/org-mode.git
     $ cd org-mode/
     $ make autoloads

   Note that in this case, ‘make autoloads’ is mandatory: it defines
Org’s version in ‘org-version.el’ and Org’s autoloads in
‘org-loaddefs.el’.

   Remember to add the correct load-path as described in the method
above.

   You can also compile with ‘make’, generate the documentation with
‘make doc’, create a local configuration with ‘make config’ and install
Org with ‘make install’.  Please run ‘make help’ to get the list of
compilation/installation options.

   For more detailed explanations on Org’s build system, please check
the Org Build System page on Worg
(https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html).

1.3 Activation
==============

Org mode buffers need Font Lock to be turned on: this is the default in
Emacs(1).

   There are compatibility issues between Org mode and some other Elisp
packages (see *note Conflicts::).  Please take the time to check the
list.

   For a better experience, the three Org commands ‘org-store-link’,
‘org-capture’ and ‘org-agenda’ ought to be accessible anywhere in Emacs,
not just in Org buffers.  To that effect, you need to bind them to
globally available keys, like the ones reserved for users (see *note
(elisp)Key Binding Conventions::).  Here are suggested bindings, please
modify the keys to your own liking.

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture)

   Files with the ‘.org’ extension use Org mode by default.  To turn on
Org mode in a file that does not have the extension ‘.org’, make the
first line of a file look like this:

     MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-

which selects Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file’s name
is.  See also the variable ‘org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file’.

   Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is _active_.
To make use of this, you need to have ‘transient-mark-mode’ turned on,
which is the default.  If you do not like ‘transient-mark-mode’, you can
create an active region by using the mouse to select a region, or
pressing ‘C-<SPC>’ twice before moving point.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you do not use Font Lock globally turn it on in Org buffer
with ‘(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)’.

1.4 Feedback
============

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please send an email to the Org mailing list
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.  You can subscribe to the list from this web
page (https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode).  If you are
not a member of the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the list
after a moderator has approved it(1).

   For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the
latest version of Org available—if you are running an outdated version,
it is quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If the bug
persists, prepare a report and provide as much information as possible,
including the version information of Emacs (‘M-x emacs-version’) and Org
(‘M-x org-version’), as well as the Org related setup in the Emacs init
file.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command

     M-x org-submit-bug-report <RET>

which puts all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so that you
only need to add your description.  If you are not sending the Email
from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your Email
program.

   Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or
Org mode setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start
Emacs with minimal customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so
often helps you determine if the problem is with your customization or
with Org mode itself.  You can start a typical minimal session with a
command like the example below.

     $ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el

   However if you are using Org mode as distributed with Emacs, a
minimal setup is not necessary.  In that case it is sufficient to start
Emacs as ‘emacs -Q’.  The ‘minimal-org.el’ setup file can have contents
as shown below.

     ;;; Minimal setup to load latest `org-mode'.

     ;; Activate debugging.
     (setq debug-on-error t
           debug-on-signal nil
           debug-on-quit nil)

     ;; Add latest Org mode to load path.
     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/lisp"))
     (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))

   If an error occurs, a “backtrace” can be very useful—see below on how
to create one.  Often a small example file helps, along with clear
information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?
  2. What did you expect to happen?
  3. What happened instead?

   Thank you for helping to improve this program.

How to create a useful backtrace
--------------------------------

If working with Org produces an error with a message you do not
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a backtrace.  This
is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the error
occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code.  To do this, use

          C-u M-x org-reload <RET>

     or, from the menu: Org → Refresh/Reload → Reload Org uncompiled.

  2. Then, activate the debugger:

          M-x toggle-debug-or-error <RET>

     or, from the menu: Options → Enter Debugger on Error.

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Do not forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a ‘*Backtrace*’ buffer appears on the
     screen.  Save this buffer to a file—for example using ‘C-x C-w’—and
     attach it to your bug report.

File: org,  Node: Conventions,  Prev: Feedback,  Up: Introduction

1.5 Typesetting Conventions Used in this Manual
===============================================

TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.
-------------------------------------

Org uses various syntactical elements: TODO keywords, tags, property
names, keywords, blocks, etc.  In this manual we use the following
conventions:

‘TODO’
‘WAITING’
     TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
     user-defined.

‘boss’
‘ARCHIVE’
     Tags are case-sensitive.  User-defined tags are written in
     lowercase; built-in tags with special meaning are written as they
     should appear in the document, usually with all capitals.

‘Release’
‘PRIORITY’
     User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

‘TITLE’
‘BEGIN’ ... ‘END’
     Keywords and blocks are written in uppercase to enhance their
     readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org files.

Key bindings and commands
-------------------------

The manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands for
accessing a functionality.  Org mode often uses the same key for
different functions, depending on context.  The command that is bound to
such keys has a generic name, like ‘org-metaright’.  In the manual we
will, wherever possible, give the function that is internally called by
the generic command.  For example, in the chapter on document structure,
‘M-<RIGHT>’ will be listed to call ‘org-do-demote’, while in the chapter
on tables, it will be listed to call ‘org-table-move-column-right’.

2.1 Outlines
============

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document to
be organized in a hierarchical structure, which, least for me, is the
best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding, i.e., hiding large parts of the
document to show only the general document structure and the parts
currently being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines
by compressing the entire show and hide functionalities into a single
command, ‘org-cycle’, which is bound to the ‘<TAB>’ key.


File: org,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility Cycling,  Prev: Outlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.2 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start with one or more stars, on the left margin(1).  For example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** Third level
         some text
     *** Third level
         more text
     * Another top level headline

   The name defined in ‘org-footnote-section’ is reserved.  Do not use
it as a title for your own headings.

   Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.  See
*note Clean View::.

   An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
is hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at least
two empty lines, one empty line remains visible after folding the
subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the variable
‘org-cycle-separator-lines’ to modify this behavior.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variables ‘org-special-ctrl-a/e’, ‘org-special-ctrl-k’,
and ‘org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree’ to configure special behavior of ‘C-a’,
‘C-e’, and ‘C-k’ in headlines.  Note also that clocking only works with
headings indented less than 30 stars.

File: org,  Node: Global and local cycling,  Next: Initial visibility,  Up: Visibility Cycling

2.3.1 Global and local cycling
------------------------------

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.  Org
uses just two commands, bound to ‘<TAB>’ and ‘S-<TAB>’ to change the
visibility in the buffer.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     Point must be on a headline for this to work(1).

‘S-<TAB>’ (‘org-global-cycle’)
‘C-u <TAB>’
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

     When ‘S-<TAB>’ is called with a numeric prefix argument N, the
     CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N are shown.  Note that
     inside tables (see *note Tables::), ‘S-<TAB>’ jumps to the previous
     field instead.

     You can run global cycling using ‘<TAB>’ only if point is at the
     very beginning of the buffer, but not on a headline, and
     ‘org-cycle-global-at-bob’ is set to a non-‘nil’ value.

‘C-u C-u <TAB>’ (‘org-set-startup-visibility’)
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer (see *note
     Initial visibility::).

‘C-u C-u C-u <TAB>’ (‘outline-show-all’)
     Show all, including drawers.

‘C-c C-r’ (‘org-reveal’)
     Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the
     following heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working near
     a location that has been exposed by a sparse tree command (see
     *note Sparse Trees::) or an agenda command (see *note Agenda
     Commands::).  With a prefix argument show, on each level, all
     sibling headings.  With a double prefix argument, also show the
     entire subtree of the parent.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘outline-show-branches’)
     Expose all the headings of the subtree, CONTENTS view for just one
     subtree.

‘C-c <TAB>’ (‘outline-show-children’)
     Expose all direct children of the subtree.  With a numeric prefix
     argument N, expose all children down to level N.

‘C-c C-x b’ (‘org-tree-to-indirect-buffer’)
     Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer(2).  With a numeric
     prefix argument, N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N
     is negative then go up that many levels.  With a ‘C-u’ prefix, do
     not remove the previously used indirect buffer.

‘C-c C-x v’ (‘org-copy-visible’)
     Copy the _visible_ text in the region into the kill ring.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See, however, the option ‘org-cycle-emulate-tab’.

   (2) The indirect buffer contains the entire buffer, but is narrowed
to the current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer also changes the
original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.  For
more information about indirect buffers, see *note GNU Emacs Manual:
(emacs)Indirect Buffers.


File: org,  Node: Initial visibility,  Next: Catching invisible edits,  Prev: Global and local cycling,  Up: Visibility Cycling

2.3.2 Initial visibility
------------------------

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible(1).  This can
be configured through the variable ‘org-startup-folded’, or on a
per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the
buffer:

     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything

   Furthermore, any entries with a ‘VISIBILITY’ property (see *note
Properties and Columns::) get their visibility adapted accordingly.
Allowed values for this property are ‘folded’, ‘children’, ‘content’,
and ‘all’.

‘C-u C-u <TAB>’ (‘org-set-startup-visibility’)
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e., whatever
     is requested by startup options and ‘VISIBILITY’ properties in
     individual entries.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When ‘org-agenda-inhibit-startup’ is non-‘nil’, Org does not
honor the default visibility state when first opening a file for the
agenda (see *note Speeding Up Your Agendas::).


File: org,  Node: Catching invisible edits,  Prev: Initial visibility,  Up: Visibility Cycling

2.3.3 Catching invisible edits
------------------------------

Sometimes you may inadvertently edit an invisible part of the buffer and
be confused on what has been edited and how to undo the mistake.
Setting ‘org-catch-invisible-edits’ to non-‘nil’ helps preventing this.
See the docstring of this option on how Org should catch invisible edits
and process them.


File: org,  Node: Motion,  Next: Structure Editing,  Prev: Visibility Cycling,  Up: Document Structure

2.4 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

‘C-c C-n’ (‘outline-next-visible-heading’)
     Next heading.

‘C-c C-p’ (‘outline-previous-visible-heading’)
     Previous heading.

‘C-c C-f’ (‘org-forward-same-level’)
     Next heading same level.

‘C-c C-b’ (‘org-backward-same-level’)
     Previous heading same level.

‘C-c C-u’ (‘outline-up-heading’)
     Backward to higher level heading.

‘C-c C-j’ (‘org-goto’)
     Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
     visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer,
     where you can use the following keys to find your destination:

     ‘<TAB>’                Cycle visibility.
     ‘<DOWN>’ / ‘<UP>’      Next/previous visible headline.
     ‘<RET>’                Select this location.
     ‘/’                    Do a Sparse-tree search

     The following keys work if you turn off ‘org-goto-auto-isearch’

     ‘n’ / ‘p’              Next/previous visible headline.
     ‘f’ / ‘b’              Next/previous headline same level.
     ‘u’                    One level up.
     ‘0’ ... ‘9’            Digit argument.
     ‘q’                    Quit.

     See also the variable ‘org-goto-interface’.


File: org,  Node: Structure Editing,  Next: Sparse Trees,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document Structure

2.5 Structure Editing
=====================

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-meta-return’)
     Insert a new heading, item or row.

     If the command is used at the _beginning_ of a line, and if there
     is a heading or a plain list item (see *note Plain Lists::) at
     point, the new heading/item is created _before_ the current line.
     When used at the beginning of a regular line of text, turn that
     line into a heading.

     When this command is used in the middle of a line, the line is
     split and the rest of the line becomes the new item or headline.
     If you do not want the line to be split, customize
     ‘org-M-RET-may-split-line’.

     Calling the command with a ‘C-u’ prefix unconditionally inserts a
     new heading at the end of the current subtree, thus preserving its
     contents.  With a double ‘C-u C-u’ prefix, the new heading is
     created at the end of the parent subtree instead.

‘C-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-heading-respect-content’)
     Insert a new heading at the end of the current subtree.

‘M-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See also
     the variable ‘org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change’.

‘C-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content’)
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  Like
     ‘C-<RET>’, the new headline is inserted after the current subtree.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     In a new entry with no text yet, the first ‘<TAB>’ demotes the
     entry to become a child of the previous one.  The next ‘<TAB>’
     makes it a parent, and so on, all the way to top level.  Yet
     another ‘<TAB>’, and you are back to the initial level.

‘M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-do-promote’)
     Promote current heading by one level.

‘M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-do-demote’)
     Demote current heading by one level.

‘M-S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-promote-subtree’)
     Promote the current subtree by one level.

‘M-S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-demote-subtree’)
     Demote the current subtree by one level.

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-move-subtree-up’)
     Move subtree up, i.e., swap with previous subtree of same level.

‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-move-subtree-down’)
     Move subtree down, i.e., swap with next subtree of same level.

‘C-c @’ (‘org-mark-subtree’)
     Mark the subtree at point.  Hitting repeatedly marks subsequent
     subtrees of the same level as the marked subtree.

‘C-c C-x C-w’ (‘org-cut-subtree’)
     Kill subtree, i.e., remove it from buffer but save in kill ring.
     With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.

‘C-c C-x M-w’ (‘org-copy-subtree’)
     Copy subtree to kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy
     the N sequential subtrees.

‘C-c C-x C-y’ (‘org-paste-subtree’)
     Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the
     subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.
     The yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix
     argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like ‘****’.

‘C-y’ (‘org-yank’)
     Depending on the variables ‘org-yank-adjusted-subtrees’ and
     ‘org-yank-folded-subtrees’, Org’s internal ‘yank’ command pastes
     subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command as ‘C-c
     C-x C-y’.  With the default settings, no level adjustment takes
     place, but the yanked tree is folded unless doing so would swallow
     text previously visible.  Any prefix argument to this command
     forces a normal ‘yank’ to be executed, with the prefix passed
     along.  A good way to force a normal yank is ‘C-u C-y’.  If you use
     ‘yank-pop’ after a yank, it yanks previous kill items plainly,
     without adjustment and folding.

‘C-c C-x c’ (‘org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift’)
     Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it.  You
     are prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can also
     specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted.  This can
     be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks related to a
     series of lectures to prepare.  For more details, see the docstring
     of the command ‘org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift’.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile’)
     Refile entry or region to a different location.  See *note Refile
     and Copy::.

‘C-c ^’ (‘org-sort’)
     Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all
     entries in the region are sorted.  Otherwise the children of the
     current headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the sorting
     method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time—first
     timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled time,
     deadline time—by priority, by TODO keyword—in the sequence the
     keywords have been defined in the setup—or by the value of a
     property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You can also
     supply your own function to extract the sorting key.  With a ‘C-u’
     prefix, sorting is case-sensitive.

‘C-x n s’ (‘org-narrow-to-subtree’)
     Narrow buffer to current subtree.

‘C-x n b’ (‘org-narrow-to-block’)
     Narrow buffer to current block.

‘C-x n w’ (‘widen’)
     Widen buffer to remove narrowing.

‘C-c *’ (‘org-toggle-heading’)
     Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline—so that it
     becomes a subheading at its location.  Also turn a headline into a
     normal line by removing the stars.  If there is an active region,
     turn all lines in the region into headlines.  If the first line in
     the region was an item, turn only the item lines into headlines.
     Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the stars from all
     headlines in the region.

   When there is an active region—i.e., when Transient Mark mode is
active—promotion and demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To
select a region of headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at
the beginning of a line, mark at the beginning of the first headline,
and point at the line just after the last headline to change.  Note that
when point is inside a table (see *note Tables::), the Meta-Cursor keys
have different functionality.

2.6 Sparse Trees
================

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it(1).  Just try it
out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

‘C-c /’ (‘org-sparse-tree’)
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.

‘C-c / r’ or ‘C-c / /’ (‘org-occur’)
     Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches.  If
     the match is in a headline, the headline is made visible.  If the
     match is in the body of an entry, headline and body are made
     visible.  In order to provide minimal context, also the full
     hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well as the
     headline following the match.  Each match is also highlighted; the
     highlights disappear when the buffer is changed by an editing
     command, or by pressing ‘C-c C-c’(2).  When called with a ‘C-u’
     prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several calls to
     this command can be stacked.

‘M-g n’ or ‘M-g M-n’ (‘next-error’)
     Jump to the next sparse tree match in this buffer.

‘M-g p’ or ‘M-g M-p’ (‘previous-error’)
     Jump to the previous sparse tree match in this buffer.

   For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the variable ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’ to define fast keyboard
access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be accessible
through the agenda dispatcher (see *note Agenda Dispatcher::).  For
example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))

defines the key ‘f’ as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree matching
the string ‘FIXME’.

   The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
keywords, tags, or properties and are discussed later in this manual.

   To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
‘ps-print-buffer-with-faces’ which does not print invisible parts of the
document.  Or you can use the command ‘C-c C-e v’ to export only the
visible part of the document and print the resulting file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variable ‘org-show-context-detail’ to decide how
much context is shown around each match.

   (2) This depends on the option ‘org-remove-highlights-with-change’.


File: org,  Node: Plain Lists,  Next: Drawers,  Prev: Sparse Trees,  Up: Document Structure

2.7 Plain Lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (see *note Checkboxes::).  Org supports editing such lists,
and every exporter (see *note Exporting::) can parse and format them.

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

   • _Unordered_ list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’(1) as bullets.

   • _Ordered_ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
     period or a right parenthesis(2), such as ‘1.’ or ‘1)’(3) If you
     want a list to start with a different value—e.g., 20—start the text
     of the item with ‘[@20]’(4).  Those constructs can be used in any
     item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering.

   • _Description_ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
     separator ‘::’ to distinguish the description _term_ from the
     description.

   Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number ‘10.’,
then the 2-digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the other
numbers in the list.  An item ends before the next line that is less or
equally indented than its bullet/number.

   A list ends whenever every item has ended, which means before any
line less or equally indented than items at top level.  It also ends
before two blank lines.  In that case, all items are closed.  Here is an
example:

     * Lord of the Rings
     My favorite scenes are (in this order)
     1. The attack of the Rohirrim
     2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
        + this was already my favorite scene in the book
        + I really like Miranda Otto.
     3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
        - on DVD only
        He makes a really funny face when it happens.
     But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
     Important actors in this film are:
     - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
     - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend. I still remember him
          very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in /The Goonies/.

   Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly, and by exporting them properly (see *note
Exporting::).  Since indentation is what governs the structure of these
lists, many structural constructs like ‘#+BEGIN_’ blocks can be indented
to signal that they belong to a particular item.

   If you find that using a different bullet for a sub-list—than that
used for the current list-level—improves readability, customize the
variable ‘org-list-demote-modify-bullet’.  To get a greater difference
of indentation between items and theirs sub-items, customize
‘org-list-indent-offset’.

   The following commands act on items when point is in the first line
of an item—the line with the bullet or number.  Some of them imply the
application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact.  If some
of these actions get in your way, configure ‘org-list-automatic-rules’
to disable them individually.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-cycle’)
     Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this works
     only if point is on a plain list item.  For more details, see the
     variable ‘org-cycle-include-plain-lists’.  If this variable is set
     to ‘integrate’, plain list items are treated like low-level
     headlines.  The level of an item is then given by the indentation
     of the bullet/number.  Items are always subordinate to real
     headlines, however; the hierarchies remain completely separated.
     In a new item with no text yet, the first ‘<TAB>’ demotes the item
     to become a child of the previous one.  Subsequent ‘<TAB>’s move
     the item to meaningful levels in the list and eventually get it
     back to its initial position.

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-heading’)
     Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a
     new heading (see *note Structure Editing::).  If this command is
     used in the middle of an item, that item is _split_ in two, and the
     second part becomes the new item(5).  If this command is executed
     _before item’s body_, the new item is created _before_ the current
     one.

‘M-S-<RET>’
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (see *note Checkboxes::).

‘S-<UP>’
‘S-<DOWN>’
     Jump to the previous/next item in the current list, but only if
     ‘org-support-shift-select’ is off(6).  If not, you can still use
     paragraph jumping commands like ‘C-<UP>’ and ‘C-<DOWN>’ to quite
     similar effect.

‘M-<UP>’
‘M-<DOWN>’
     Move the item including subitems up/down(7), i.e., swap with
     previous/next item of same indentation.  If the list is ordered,
     renumbering is automatic.

‘M-<LEFT>’
‘M-<RIGHT>’
     Decrease/increase the indentation of an item, leaving children
     alone.

‘M-S-<LEFT>’
‘M-S-<RIGHT>’
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
     Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
     When these commands are executed several times in direct
     succession, the initially selected region is used, even if the new
     indentation would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new
     hierarchy, break the command chain by moving point.

     As a special case, using this command on the very first item of a
     list moves the whole list.  This behavior can be disabled by
     configuring ‘org-list-automatic-rules’.  The global indentation of
     a list has no influence on the text _after_ the list.

‘C-c C-c’
     If there is a checkbox (see *note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  In any case, verify bullets and
     indentation consistency in the whole list.

‘C-c -’
     Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate
     bullets (‘-’, ‘+’, ‘*’, ‘1.’, ‘1)’) or a subset of them, depending
     on ‘org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator’, the type of list, and
     its indentation.  With a numeric prefix argument N, select the Nth
     bullet from this list.  If there is an active region when calling
     this, selected text is changed into an item.  With a prefix
     argument, all lines are converted to list items.  If the first line
     already was a list item, any item marker is removed from the list.
     Finally, even without an active region, a normal line is converted
     into a list item.

‘C-c *’
     Turn a plain list item into a headline—so that it becomes a
     subheading at its location.  See *note Structure Editing::, for a
     detailed explanation.

‘C-c C-*’
     Turn the whole plain list into a subtree of the current heading.
     Checkboxes (see *note Checkboxes::) become TODO, respectively DONE,
     keywords when unchecked, respectively checked.

‘S-<LEFT>’
‘S-<RIGHT>’
     This command also cycles bullet styles when point is in on the
     bullet or anywhere in an item line, details depending on
     ‘org-support-shift-select’.

‘C-c ^’
     Sort the plain list.  Prompt for the sorting method: numerically,
     alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When using ‘*’ as a bullet, lines must be indented so that they
are not interpreted as headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a star
may be hard to distinguish from true headlines.  In short: even though
‘*’ is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list items.

   (2) You can filter out any of them by configuring
‘org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator’.

   (3) You can also get ‘a.’, ‘A.’, ‘a)’ and ‘A)’ by configuring
‘org-list-allow-alphabetical’.  To minimize confusion with normal text,
those are limited to one character only.  Beyond that limit, bullets
automatically become numbers.

   (4) If there’s a checkbox in the item, the cookie must be put
_before_ the checkbox.  If you have activated alphabetical lists, you
can also use counters like ‘[@b]’.

   (5) If you do not want the item to be split, customize the variable
‘org-M-RET-may-split-line’.

   (6) If you want to cycle around items that way, you may customize
‘org-list-use-circular-motion’.

   (7) See ‘org-list-use-circular-motion’ for a cyclic behavior.


File: org,  Node: Drawers,  Next: Blocks,  Prev: Plain Lists,  Up: Document Structure

2.8 Drawers
===========

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally do not want to see it.  For this, Org mode has _drawers_.  They
can contain anything but a headline and another drawer.  Drawers look
like this:

     ** This is a headline
     Still outside the drawer
     :DRAWERNAME:
     This is inside the drawer.
     :END:
     After the drawer.

   You can interactively insert a drawer at point by calling
‘org-insert-drawer’, which is bound to ‘C-c C-x d’.  With an active
region, this command puts the region inside the drawer.  With a prefix
argument, this command calls ‘org-insert-property-drawer’, which creates
a ‘PROPERTIES’ drawer right below the current headline.  Org mode uses
this special drawer for storing properties (see *note Properties and
Columns::).  You cannot use it for anything else.

   Completion over drawer keywords is also possible using ‘M-<TAB>’(1).

   Visibility cycling (see *note Visibility Cycling::) on the headline
hides and shows the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single
line.  In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move point to the
drawer line and press ‘<TAB>’ there.

   You can also arrange for state change notes (see *note Tracking TODO
state changes::) and clock times (see *note Clocking Work Time::) to be
stored in a ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer.  If you want to store a quick note there,
in a similar way to state changes, use

‘C-c C-z’
     Add a time-stamped note to the ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Many desktops intercept ‘M-<TAB>’ to switch windows.  Use ‘C-M-i’
or ‘<ESC> <TAB>’ instead.

2.9 Blocks
==========

Org mode uses ‘#+BEGIN’ ... ‘#+END’ blocks for various purposes from
including source code examples (see *note Literal Examples::) to
capturing time logging information (see *note Clocking Work Time::).
These blocks can be folded and unfolded by pressing ‘<TAB>’ in the
‘#+BEGIN’ line.  You can also get all blocks folded at startup by
configuring the variable ‘org-hide-block-startup’ or on a per-file basis
by using

     #+STARTUP: hideblocks
     #+STARTUP: nohideblocks

2.10 Creating Footnotes
=======================

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.

   A footnote is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in
column 0, no indentation allowed.  It ends at the next footnote
definition, headline, or after two consecutive empty lines.  The
footnote reference is simply the marker in square brackets, inside text.
Markers always start with ‘fn:’.  For example:

     The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
     ...
     [fn:1] The link is: https://orgmode.org

   Org mode extends the number-based syntax to _named_ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Here are the valid references:

‘[fn:NAME]’
     A named footnote reference, where NAME is a unique label word, or,
     for simplicity of automatic creation, a number.

‘[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]’
     A LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given
     directly at the reference point.

‘[fn:NAME: a definition]’
     An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name for
     the note.  Since Org allows multiple references to the same note,
     you can then use ‘[fn:NAME]’ to create additional references.

   Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create names
yourself.  This is handled by the variable ‘org-footnote-auto-label’ and
its corresponding ‘STARTUP’ keywords.  See the docstring of that
variable for details.

   The following command handles footnotes:

‘C-c C-x f’
     The footnote action command.

     When point is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.
     When it is at a definition, jump to the—first—reference.

     Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the variable
     ‘org-footnote-define-inline’(1), the definition is placed right
     into the text as part of the reference, or separately into the
     location determined by the variable ‘org-footnote-section’.

     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of
     additional options is offered:

     ‘s’     Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.
     ‘r’     Renumber the simple ‘fn:N’ footnotes.
     ‘S’     Short for first ‘r’, then ‘s’ action.
     ‘n’     Rename all footnotes into a ‘fn:1’ ... ‘fn:n’ sequence.
     ‘d’     Delete the footnote at point, including definition and
             references.

     Depending on the variable ‘org-footnote-auto-adjust’(2),
     renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each
     insertion or deletion.

‘C-c C-c’
     If point is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.  If it
     is at the definition, jump back to the reference.  When called at a
     footnote location with a prefix argument, offer the same menu as
     ‘C-c C-x f’.

‘C-c C-o’ or ‘mouse-1/2’
     Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding definition or
     reference, and you can use the usual commands to follow these
     links.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ‘#+STARTUP: fninline’ or
‘#+STARTUP: nofninline’.

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer options are ‘#+STARTUP: fnadjust’ and
‘#+STARTUP: nofnadjust’.

3 Tables
********

Org comes with a fast and intuitive table editor.  Spreadsheet-like
calculations are supported using the Emacs Calc package (see *note GNU
Emacs Calculator Manual: (calc)Top.).

* Menu:

* Built-in Table Editor::        Simple tables.
* Column Width and Alignment::   Overrule the automatic settings.
* Column Groups::                Grouping to trigger vertical lines.

File: org,  Node: Built-in Table Editor,  Next: Column Width and Alignment,  Up: Tables

3.1 Built-in Table Editor
=========================

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with ‘|’ as
the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.  ‘|’
is also the column separator(1).  Moreover, a line starting with ‘|-’ is
a horizontal rule.  It separates rows explicitely.  Rows before the
first horizontal rule are header lines.  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press ‘<TAB>’,
‘<RET>’ or ‘C-c C-c’ inside the table.  ‘<TAB>’ also moves to the next
field—‘<RET>’ to the next row—and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Horizontal rules are automatically expanded on
every re-align to span the whole table width.  So, to create the above
table, you would only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press ‘<TAB>’ to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type ‘|Name|Phone|Age’ followed by ‘C-c <RET>’.

   When typing text into a field, Org treats ‘DEL’, ‘Backspace’, and all
character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting avoids
shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately_ after point was
moved into a new field with ‘<TAB>’, ‘S-<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’, the field is
automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too unpredictable for
you, configure the option ‘org-table-auto-blank-field’.

Creation and conversion
-----------------------

‘C-c |’ (‘org-table-create-or-convert-from-region’)
     Convert the active region to table.  If every line contains at
     least one ‘<TAB>’ character, the function assumes that the material
     is tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: ‘C-u’ forces CSV, ‘C-u C-u’ forces ‘<TAB>’, ‘C-u C-u
     C-u’ prompts for a regular expression to match the separator, and a
     numeric argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or
     alternatively a ‘<TAB>’ will be the separator.

     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it is easier just to start typing, like ‘| N a m e | P
     h o n e | A g e <RET> | - <TAB>’.

Re-aligning and field motion
----------------------------

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-table-align’)
     Re-align the table without moving point.

‘<TAB>’ (‘org-table-next-field’)
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.

‘C-c <SPC>’ (‘org-table-blank-field’)
     Blank the field at point.

‘S-<TAB>’ (‘org-table-previous-field’)
     Re-align, move to previous field.

‘<RET>’ (‘org-table-next-row’)
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, ‘<RET>’ still
     inserts a new line, so it can be used to split a table.

‘M-a’ (‘org-table-beginning-of-field’)
     Move to beginning of the current table field, or on to the previous
     field.

‘M-e’ (‘org-table-end-of-field’)
     Move to end of the current table field, or on to the next field.

Column and row editing
----------------------

‘M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-table-move-column-left’)
     Move the current column left.

‘M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-table-move-column-right’)
     Move the current column right.

‘M-S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-table-delete-column’)
     Kill the current column.

‘M-S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-table-insert-column’)
     Insert a new column to the left of point position.

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-table-move-row-up’)
     Move the current row up.

‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-move-row-down’)
     Move the current row down.

‘M-S-<UP>’ (‘org-table-kill-row’)
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.

‘M-S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-insert-row’)
     Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument,
     the line is created below the current one.

‘C-c -’ (‘org-table-insert-hline’)
     Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix
     argument, the line is created above the current line.

‘C-c <RET>’ (‘org-table-hline-and-move’)
     Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move point into the
     row below that line.

‘C-c ^’ (‘org-table-sort-lines’)
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of lines
     is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines, or the
     entire table.  If point is before the first column, you are
     prompted for the sorting column.  If there is an active region, the
     mark specifies the first line and the sorting column, while point
     should be in the last line to be included into the sorting.  The
     command prompts for the sorting type, alphabetically, numerically,
     or by time.  You can sort in normal or reverse order.  You can also
     supply your own key extraction and comparison functions.  When
     called with a prefix argument, alphabetic sorting is
     case-sensitive.

Regions
-------

‘C-c C-x M-w’ (‘org-table-copy-region’)
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.
     Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  If there is
     no active region, copy just the current field.  The process ignores
     horizontal separator lines.

‘C-c C-x C-w’ (‘org-table-cut-region’)
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
     blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the “cut” operation.

‘C-c C-x C-y’ (‘org-table-paste-rectangle’)
     Paste a rectangular region into a table.  The upper left corner
     ends up in the current field.  All involved fields are overwritten.
     If the rectangle does not fit into the present table, the table is
     enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal separator
     lines.

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-table-wrap-region’)
     Split the current field at point position and move the rest to the
     line below.  If there is an active region, and both point and mark
     are in the same column, the text in the column is wrapped to
     minimum width for the given number of lines.  A numeric prefix
     argument may be used to change the number of desired lines.  If
     there is no region, but you specify a prefix argument, the current
     field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
     above.

Calculations
------------

‘C-c +’ (‘org-table-sum’)
     Sum the numbers in the current column, or in the rectangle defined
     by the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
     be inserted with ‘C-y’.

‘S-<RET>’ (‘org-table-copy-down’)
     When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field above.
     When not empty, copy current field down to next row and move point
     along with it.  Depending on the variable
     ‘org-table-copy-increment’, integer field values can be incremented
     during copy.  Integers that are too large are not incremented,
     however.  Also, a ‘0’ prefix argument temporarily disables the
     increment.  This key is also used by shift-selection and related
     modes (see *note Conflicts::).

Miscellaneous
-------------

‘C-c `’ (‘org-table-edit-field’)
     Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for
     fields that are not fully visible (see *note Column Width and
     Alignment::).  When called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, just make the full
     field visible, so that it can be edited in place.  When called with
     two ‘C-u’ prefixes, make the editor window follow point through the
     table and always show the current field.  The follow mode exits
     automatically when point leaves the table, or when you repeat this
     command with ‘C-u C-u C-c `’.

‘M-x org-table-import’
     Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB or whitespace
     separated.  Use, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
     from a database, because these programs generally can write
     TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the file
     into the buffer and then converting the region to a table.  Any
     prefix argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it to
     determine the separator.

‘C-c |’ (‘org-table-create-or-convert-from-region’)
     Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org
     buffer, selecting the pasted text with ‘C-x C-x’ and then using the
     ‘C-c |’ command (see *note Creation and conversion::).

‘M-x org-table-export’
     Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
     exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The
     format used to export the file can be configured in the variable
     ‘org-table-export-default-format’.  You may also use properties
     ‘TABLE_EXPORT_FILE’ and ‘TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT’ to specify the file
     name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports
     quite general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is
     the same as the format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see *note
     Translator functions::, for a detailed description.

inside a word ‘abc\vert{}def’.


File: org,  Node: Column Width and Alignment,  Next: Column Groups,  Prev: Built-in Table Editor,  Up: Tables

3.2 Column Width and Alignment
==============================

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
The alignment of a column is determined automatically from the fraction
of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

   Editing a field may modify alignment of the table.  Moving a
contiguous row or column—i.e., using ‘<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’—automatically
re-aligns it.  If you want to disable this behavior, set
‘org-table-automatic-realign’ to ‘nil’.  In any case, you can always
align manually a table:

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-table-align’)
     Align the current table.

   Setting the option ‘org-startup-align-all-tables’ re-aligns all
tables in a file upon visiting it.  You can also set this option on a
per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign

   Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  Maybe you want to hide away
several columns or display them with a fixed width, regardless of
content, as shown in the following example.

     |---+---------------------+--------|           |---+-------…|…|
     |   | <6>                 |        |           |   | <6>   …|…|
     | 1 | one                 | some   |   ----\   | 1 | one   …|…|
     | 2 | two                 | boring |   ----/   | 2 | two   …|…|
     | 3 | This is a long text | column |           | 3 | This i…|…|
     |---+---------------------+--------|           |---+-------…|…|

   To set the width of a column, one field anywhere in the column may
contain just the string ‘<N>’ where N specifies the width as a number of
characters.  You control displayed width of columns with the following
tools:

‘C-c <TAB>’ (‘org-table-toggle-column-width’)
     Shrink or expand current column.

     If a width cookie specifies a width W for the column, shrinking it
     displays the first W visible characters only.  Otherwise, the
     column is shrunk to a single character.

     When called before the first column or after the last one, ask for
     a list of column ranges to operate on.

‘C-u C-c <TAB>’ (‘org-table-shrink’)
     Shrink all columns with a column width.  Expand the others.

‘C-u C-u C-c <TAB>’ (‘org-table-expand’)
     Expand all columns.

   To see the full text of a shrunk field, hold the mouse over it: a
tool-tip window then shows the full contents of the field.
Alternatively, ‘C-h .’ (‘display-local-help’) reveals them, too.  For
convenience, any change near the shrunk part of a column expands it.

   Setting the option ‘org-startup-shrink-all-tables’ shrinks all
columns containing a width cookie in a file the moment it is visited.
You can also set this option on a per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: shrink

   If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
columns to the right and of string-rich columns to the left, you can use
‘<r>’, ‘<c>’ or ‘<l>’ in a similar fashion.  You may also combine
alignment and field width like this: ‘<r10>’.

   Lines which only contain these formatting cookies are removed
automatically upon exporting the document.

3.3 Column Groups
=================

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines
because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only ‘/’.  The further fields can either contain
‘<’ to indicate that this column should start a group, ‘>’ to indicate
the end of a column, or ‘<>’ (no space between ‘<’ and ‘>’) to make a
column a group of its own.  Upon export, boundaries between column
groups are marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:

     | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / |  <  |     |  >  |       < |          > |
     | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |       1 |          1 |
     | 2 |  4  |  8  | 16  |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
     | 3 |  9  | 27  | 81  |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
     |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1^2::$3=$1^3::$4=$1^4::$5=sqrt($1)::$6=sqrt(sqrt(($1)))

   It is also sufficient to just insert the column group starters after
every vertical line you would like to have:

     | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / | <   |     |     | <       |            |

3.4 The Orgtbl Minor Mode
=========================

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you might also
want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.  The minor
mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle the mode
with ‘M-x orgtbl-mode’.  To turn it on by default, for example in
Message mode, use

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)

   Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see *note
Tables in Arbitrary Syntax::.


File: org,  Node: The Spreadsheet,  Next: Org Plot,  Prev: Orgtbl Mode,  Up: Tables

3.5 The Spreadsheet
===================

The table editor makes use of the Emacs Calc package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org’s
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example, Org
knows the concept of a _column formula_ that will be applied to all
non-header fields in a column without having to copy the formula to each
relevant field.  There is also a formula debugger, and a formula editor
with features for highlighting fields in the table corresponding to the
references at point in the formula, moving these references by arrow
keys.

File: org,  Node: References,  Next: Formula syntax for Calc,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.1 References
----------------

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced by
name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find out
what the coordinates of a field are, press ‘C-c ?’ in that field, or
press ‘C-c }’ to toggle the display of a grid.

Field references
................

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like ‘B3’, meaning the second field in the third row.
However, Org prefers to use another, more general representation that
looks like this:(1)

     @ROW$COLUMN

   Column specifications can be absolute like ‘$1’, ‘$2’, ..., ‘$N’, or
relative to the current column, i.e., the column of the field which is
being computed, like ‘$+1’ or ‘$-2’.  ‘$<’ and ‘$>’ are immutable
references to the first and last column, respectively, and you can use
‘$>>>’ to indicate the third column from the right.

   The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines, or “hlines”.  Like with columns, you can use absolute
row numbers ‘@1’, ‘@2’, ..., ‘@N’, and row numbers relative to the
current row like ‘@+3’ or ‘@-1’.  ‘@<’ and ‘@>’ are immutable references
the first and last row in the table, respectively.  You may also specify
the row relative to one of the hlines: ‘@I’ refers to the first hline,
‘@II’ to the second, etc.  ‘@-I’ refers to the first such line above the
current line, ‘@+I’ to the first such line below the current line.  You
can also write ‘@III+2’ which is the second data line after the third
hline in the table.

   ‘@0’ and ‘$0’ refer to the current row and column, respectively,
i.e., to the row/column for the field being computed.  Also, if you omit
either the column or the row part of the reference, the current
row/column is implied.

   Org’s references with _unsigned_ numbers are fixed references in the
sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field is referenced each time.  Org’s
references with _signed_ numbers are floating references because the
same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the
field being calculated by the formula.

   Here are a few examples:

‘@2$3’         2nd row, 3rd column (same as ‘C2’)
‘$5’           column 5 in the current row (same as ‘E&’)
‘@2’           current column, row 2
‘@-1$-3’       field one row up, three columns to the left
‘@-I$2’        field just under hline above current row, column 2
‘@>$5’         field in the last row, in column 5

Range references
................

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots ‘..’.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use ‘$2..$7’, but if at least one field is
in a different row, you need to use the general ‘@ROW$COLUMN’ format at
least for the first field, i.e., the reference must start with ‘@’ in
order to be interpreted correctly.  Examples:

‘$1..$3’       first three fields in the current row
‘$P..$Q’       range, using column names (see
               *note Advanced features::)
‘$<<<..$>>’    start in third column, continue to the last but one
‘@2$1..@4$3’   six fields between these two fields (same as ‘A2..C4’)
‘@-1$-2..@-1’  3 fields in the row above, starting from 2 columns on
               the left
‘@I..II’       between first and second hline, short for ‘@I..@II’

Range references return a vector of values that can be fed into Calc
vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed, so
that the vector contains only the non-empty fields.  For other options
with the mode switches ‘E’, ‘N’ and examples, see *note Formula syntax
for Calc::.

Field coordinates in formulas
.............................

One of the very first actions during evaluation of Calc formulas and
Lisp formulas is to substitute ‘@#’ and ‘$#’ in the formula with the row
or column number of the field where the current result will go to.  The
traditional Lisp formula equivalents are ‘org-table-current-dline’ and
‘org-table-current-column’.  Examples:

‘if(@# % 2, $#, string(""))’
     Insert column number on odd rows, set field to empty on even rows.

‘$2 = '(identity remote(FOO, @@#$1))’
     Copy text or values of each row of column 1 of the table named FOO
     into column 2 of the current table.

‘@3 = 2 * remote(FOO, @@1$$#)’
     Insert the doubled value of each column of row 1 of the table named
     FOO into row 3 of the current table.

For the second and third examples, table FOO must have at least as many
rows or columns as the current table.  Note that this is inefficient(2)
for large number of rows.

Named references
................

‘$name’ is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or constant.
Constants are defined globally through the variable
‘org-table-formula-constants’, and locally—for the file—through a line
like this example:

     #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6

   Also, properties (see *note Properties and Columns::) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property ‘Xyz’ use the name
‘$PROP_Xyz’, and the property will be searched in the current outline
entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the ‘constants.el’
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like ‘$h’ for Planck’s constant, and units like ‘$km’ for
kilometers(3).  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described below, see *note Advanced features::.
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

Remote references
.................

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different
table, either in the current file or even in a different file.  The
syntax is

     remote(NAME,REF)

where NAME can be the name of a table in the current file as set by a
‘#+NAME:’ line before the table.  It can also be the ID of an entry,
even in a different file, and the reference then refers to the first
table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field or range reference as
described above for example ‘@3$3’ or ‘$somename’, valid in the
referenced table.

   When NAME has the format ‘@ROW$COLUMN’, it is substituted with the
name or ID found in this field of the current table.  For example
‘remote($1, @@>$2)’ ⇒ ‘remote(year_2013, @@>$1)’.  The format ‘B3’ is
not supported because it can not be distinguished from a plain table
name or ID.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org understands references typed by the user as ‘B4’, but it does
not use this syntax when offering a formula for editing.  You can
customize this behavior using the variable
‘org-table-use-standard-references’.

   (2) The computation time scales as O(N^2) because table FOO is parsed
for each field to be copied.

   (3) The file ‘constants.el’ can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, ‘SI’ and ‘cgs’.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable ‘constants-unit-system’.  You can use the
‘STARTUP’ options ‘constSI’ and ‘constcgs’ to set this value for the
current buffer.

3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc
-----------------------------

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs Calc
package.  Note that Calc has the non-standard convention that ‘/’ has
lower precedence than ‘*’, so that ‘a/b*c’ is interpreted as
‘(a/(b*c))’.  Before evaluation by ‘calc-eval’ (see *note Calling Calc
from Your Lisp Programs: (calc)Calling Calc from Your Programs.),
variable substitution takes place according to the rules described
above.

   The range vectors can be directly fed into the Calc vector functions
like ‘vmean’ and ‘vsum’.

   A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.
This string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision 12,
angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to ‘(float 8)’ to keep tables compact.
The default settings can be configured using the variable
‘org-calc-default-modes’.

‘p20’
     Set the internal Calc calculation precision to 20 digits.

‘n3’, ‘s3’, ‘e2’, ‘f4’
     Normal, scientific, engineering or fixed format of the result of
     Calc passed back to Org.  Calc formatting is unlimited in precision
     as long as the Calc calculation precision is greater.

‘D’, ‘R’
     Degree and radian angle modes of Calc.

‘F’, ‘S’
     Fraction and symbolic modes of Calc.

‘T’, ‘t’, ‘U’
     Duration computations in Calc or Lisp, *note Durations and time
     values::.

‘E’
     If and how to consider empty fields.  Without ‘E’ empty fields in
     range references are suppressed so that the Calc vector or Lisp
     list contains only the non-empty fields.  With ‘E’ the empty fields
     are kept.  For empty fields in ranges or empty field references the
     value ‘nan’ (not a number) is used in Calc formulas and the empty
     string is used for Lisp formulas.  Add ‘N’ to use 0 instead for
     both formula types.  For the value of a field the mode ‘N’ has
     higher precedence than ‘E’.

‘N’
     Interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers.  See the
     next section to see how this is essential for computations with
     Lisp formulas.  In Calc formulas it is used only occasionally
     because there number strings are already interpreted as numbers
     without ‘N’.

‘L’
     Literal, for Lisp formulas only.  See the next section.

   Unless you use large integer numbers or high-precision calculation
and display for floating point numbers you may alternatively provide a
‘printf’ format specifier to reformat the Calc result after it has been
passed back to Org instead of letting Calc already do the formatting(1).
A few examples:

‘$1+$2’              Sum of first and second field
‘$1+$2;%.2f’         Same, format result to two decimals
‘exp($2)+exp($1)’    Math functions can be used
‘$0;%.1f’            Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
‘($3-32)*5/9’        Degrees F → C conversion
‘$c/$1/$cm’          Hz → cm conversion, using ‘constants.el’
‘tan($1);Dp3s1’      Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
‘sin($1);Dp3%.1e’    Same, but use ‘printf’ specifier for display
‘vmean($2..$7)’      Compute column range mean, using vector function
‘vmean($2..$7);EN’   Same, but treat empty fields as 0
‘taylor($3,x=7,2)’   Taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

   Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations (see *note
Logical Operations: (calc)Logical Operations.).  For example

‘if($1 < 20, teen, string(""))’
     ‘"teen"’ if age ‘$1’ is less than 20, else the Org table result
     field is set to empty with the empty string.

‘if("$1" =​= "nan" || "$2" =​= "nan", string(""), $1 + $2); E f-1’
     Sum of the first two columns.  When at least one of the input
     fields is empty the Org table result field is set to empty.  ‘E’ is
     required to not convert empty fields to 0.  ‘f-1’ is an optional
     Calc format string similar to ‘%.1f’ but leaves empty results
     empty.

‘if(typeof(vmean($1..$7)) =​= 12, string(""), vmean($1..$7); E’
     Mean value of a range unless there is any empty field.  Every field
     in the range that is empty is replaced by ‘nan’ which lets ‘vmean’
     result in ‘nan’.  Then ‘typeof =’ 12= detects the ‘nan’ from
     ‘vmean’ and the Org table result field is set to empty.  Use this
     when the sample set is expected to never have missing values.

‘if("$1..$7" =​= "[]", string(""), vmean($1..$7))’
     Mean value of a range with empty fields skipped.  Every field in
     the range that is empty is skipped.  When all fields in the range
     are empty the mean value is not defined and the Org table result
     field is set to empty.  Use this when the sample set can have a
     variable size.

‘vmean($1..$7); EN’
     To complete the example before: Mean value of a range with empty
     fields counting as samples with value 0.  Use this only when
     incomplete sample sets should be padded with 0 to the full size.

   You can add your own Calc functions defined in Emacs Lisp with
‘defmath’ and use them in formula syntax for Calc.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The printf reformatting is limited in precision because the value
passed to it is converted into an “integer” or “double”.  The “integer”
is limited in size by truncating the signed value to 32 bits.  The
“double” is limited in precision to 64 bits overall which leaves
approximately 16 significant decimal digits.


File: org,  Node: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Next: Durations and time values,  Prev: Formula syntax for Calc,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.3 Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
----------------------------------

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp.  This can be
useful for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc’s
functionality is not enough.

   If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an opening
parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The evaluation should
return either a string or a number.  Just as with Calc formulas, you can
specify modes and a ‘printf’ format after a semicolon.

   With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the way field
references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a reference is
interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes) containing the field.
If you provide the ‘N’ mode switch, all referenced elements are
numbers—non-number fields will be zero—and interpolated as Lisp numbers,
without quotes.  If you provide the ‘L’ flag, all fields are
interpolated literally, without quotes.  For example, if you want a
reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp form, enclose the
reference operator itself in double-quotes, like ‘"$3"’.  Ranges are
inserted as space-separated fields, so you can embed them in list or
vector syntax.

   Here are a few examples—note how the ‘N’ mode is used when we do
computations in Lisp:

‘'(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))’
     Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1.

‘'(+ $1 $2);N’
     Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc’s ‘$1+$2’.

‘'(apply '+ '($1..$4));N’
     Compute the sum of columns 1 to 4, like Calc’s ‘vsum($1..$4)’.


File: org,  Node: Durations and time values,  Next: Field and range formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.4 Durations and time values
-------------------------------

If you want to compute time values use the ‘T’, ‘t’, or ‘U’ flag, either
in Calc formulas or Elisp formulas:

     |  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
     |---------+----------+----------|
     |    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |
     |    2:12 |     1:47 |    03:59 |
     | 3:02:20 | -2:07:00 |     0.92 |
     #+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T::@3$3=$1+$2;U::@4$3=$1+$2;t

   Input duration values must be of the form ‘HH:MM[:SS]’, where seconds
are optional.  With the ‘T’ flag, computed durations are displayed as
‘HH:MM:SS’ (see the first formula above).  With the ‘U’ flag, seconds
are omitted so that the result is only ‘HH:MM’ (see second formula
above).  Zero-padding of the hours field depends upon the value of the
variable ‘org-table-duration-hour-zero-padding’.

   With the ‘t’ flag, computed durations are displayed according to the
value of the option ‘org-table-duration-custom-format’, which defaults
to ‘hours’ and displays the result as a fraction of hours (see the third
formula in the example above).

   Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers are
considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.


File: org,  Node: Field and range formulas,  Next: Column formulas,  Prev: Durations and time values,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.5 Field and range formulas
------------------------------

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by ‘:=’, for example ‘vsum(@II..III)’.  When you press
‘<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’ or ‘C-c C-c’ with point still in the field, the
formula is stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field is replaced with the result.

   Formulas are stored in a special ‘TBLFM’ keyword located directly
below the table.  If you type the equation in the fourth field of the
third data line in the table, the formula looks like ‘@3$4=$1+$2’.  When
inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with the appropriate
commands, _absolute references_ (but not relative ones) in stored
formulas are modified in order to still reference the same field.  To
avoid this from happening, in particular in range references, anchor
ranges at the table borders (using ‘@<’, ‘@>’, ‘$<’, ‘$>’), or at hlines
using the ‘@I’ notation.  Automatic adaptation of field references does
not happen if you edit the table structure with normal editing
commands—you must fix the formulas yourself.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

‘C-u C-c =’ (‘org-table-eval-formula’)
     Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts
     for a formula with default taken from the ‘TBLFM’ keyword, applies
     it to the current field, and stores it.

   The left-hand side of a formula can also be a special expression in
order to assign the formula to a number of different fields.  There is
no keyboard shortcut to enter such range formulas.  To add them, use the
formula editor (see *note Editing and debugging formulas::) or edit the
‘TBLFM’ keyword directly.

‘$2=’
     Column formula, valid for the entire column.  This is so common
     that Org treats these formulas in a special way, see *note Column
     formulas::.

‘@3=’
     Row formula, applies to all fields in the specified row.  ‘@>=’
     means the last row.

‘@1$2..@4$3=’
     Range formula, applies to all fields in the given rectangular
     range.  This can also be used to assign a formula to some but not
     all fields in a row.

‘$NAME=’
     Named field, see *note Advanced features::.

3.5.6 Column formulas
---------------------

When you assign a formula to a simple column reference like ‘$3=’, the
same formula is used in all fields of that column, with the following
very convenient exceptions: (i) If the table contains horizontal
separator hlines with rows above and below, everything before the first
such hline is considered part of the table _header_ and is not modified
by column formulas.  Therefore a header is mandatory when you use column
formulas and want to add hlines to group rows, like for example to
separate a total row at the bottom from the summand rows above.  (ii)
Fields that already get a value from a field/range formula are left
alone by column formulas.  These conditions make column formulas very
easy to use.

   To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like ‘=$1+$2’.  When you press
‘<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’ or ‘C-c C-c’ with point still in the field, the
formula is stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated and
the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains only
‘=’, the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For each
column, Org only remembers the most recently used formula.  In the
‘TBLFM’ keyword, column formulas look like ‘$4=$1+$2’.  The left-hand
side of a column formula can not be the name of column, it must be the
numeric column reference or ‘$>’.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

‘C-c =’ (‘org-table-eval-formula’)
     Install a new formula for the current column and replace current
     field with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a
     formula, with default taken from the ‘TBLFM’ keyword, applies it to
     the current field and stores it.  With a numeric prefix argument,
     e.g., ‘C-5 C-c =’, the command applies it to that many consecutive
     fields in the current column.


File: org,  Node: Lookup functions,  Next: Editing and debugging formulas,  Prev: Column formulas,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.7 Lookup functions
----------------------

Org has three predefined Emacs Lisp functions for lookups in tables.

‘(org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)’
     Searches for the first element S in list S-LIST for which
          (PREDICATE VAL S)
     is non-‘nil’; returns the value from the corresponding position in
     list R-LIST.  The default PREDICATE is ‘equal’.  Note that the
     parameters VAL and S are passed to PREDICATE in the same order as
     the corresponding parameters are in the call to ‘org-lookup-first’,
     where VAL precedes S-LIST.  If R-LIST is ‘nil’, the matching
     element S of S-LIST is returned.

‘(org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)’
     Similar to ‘org-lookup-first’ above, but searches for the _last_
     element for which PREDICATE is non-‘nil’.

‘(org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)’
     Similar to ‘org-lookup-first’, but searches for _all_ elements for
     which PREDICATE is non-‘nil’, and returns _all_ corresponding
     values.  This function can not be used by itself in a formula,
     because it returns a list of values.  However, powerful lookups can
     be built when this function is combined with other Emacs Lisp
     functions.

   If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the ‘E’
mode for the formula should usually be specified: otherwise empty fields
are not included in S-LIST and/or R-LIST which can, for example, result
in an incorrect mapping from an element of S-LIST to the corresponding
element of R-LIST.

   These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays,
count matching cells, rank results, group data, etc.  For practical
examples see this tutorial on Worg
(https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html).


File: org,  Node: Editing and debugging formulas,  Next: Updating the table,  Prev: Lookup functions,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.8 Editing and debugging formulas
------------------------------------

You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org can also prepare a special buffer with all active formulas
of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org converts
references to the standard format (like ‘B3’ or ‘D&’) if possible.  If
you prefer to only work with the internal format (like ‘@3$2’ or ‘$4’),
configure the variable ‘org-table-use-standard-references’.

‘C-c =’ or ‘C-u C-c =’ (‘org-table-eval-formula’)
     Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
     minibuffer.  See *note Column formulas::, and *note Field and range
     formulas::.

‘C-u C-u C-c =’ (‘org-table-eval-formula’)
     Re-insert the active formula (either a field formula, or a column
     formula) into the current field, so that you can edit it directly
     in the field.  The advantage over editing in the minibuffer is that
     you can use the command ‘C-c ?’.

‘C-c ?’ (‘org-table-field-info’)
     While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
     referenced by the reference at point position in the formula.

‘C-c }’ (‘org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays’)
     Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using
     overlays.  These are updated each time the table is aligned; you
     can force it with ‘C-c C-c’.

‘C-c {’ (‘org-table-toggle-formula-debugger’)
     Toggle the formula debugger on and off.  See below.

‘C-c '’ (‘org-table-edit-formulas’)
     Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where
     the formulas are displayed one per line.  If the current field has
     an active formula, point in the formula editor marks it.  While
     inside the special buffer, Org automatically highlights any field
     or range reference at point position.  You may edit, remove and add
     formulas, and use the following commands:

     ‘C-c C-c’ or ‘C-x C-s’ (‘org-table-fedit-finish’)
          Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.  With
          ‘C-u’ prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire table.

     ‘C-c C-q’ (‘org-table-fedit-abort’)
          Exit the formula editor without installing changes.

     ‘C-c C-r’ (‘org-table-fedit-toggle-ref-type’)
          Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard
          (like ‘B3’) and internal (like ‘@3$2’).

     ‘<TAB>’ (‘org-table-fedit-lisp-indent’)
          Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line
          containing a Lisp formula, format the formula according to
          Emacs Lisp rules.  Another ‘<TAB>’ collapses the formula back
          again.  In the open formula, ‘<TAB>’ re-indents just like in
          Emacs Lisp mode.

     ‘M-<TAB>’ (‘lisp-complete-symbol’)
          Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.

     ‘S-<UP>’, ‘S-<DOWN>’, ‘S-<LEFT>’, ‘S-<RIGHT>’
          Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference
          is ‘B3’ and you press ‘S-<RIGHT>’, it becomes ‘C3’.  This also
          works for relative references and for hline references.

     ‘M-S-<UP>’ (‘org-table-fedit-line-up’)
          Move the test line for column formulas up in the Org buffer.

     ‘M-S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-fedit-line-down’)
          Move the test line for column formulas down in the Org buffer.

     ‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-table-fedit-scroll-up’)
          Scroll up the window displaying the table.

     ‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-table-fedit-scroll-down’)
          Scroll down the window displaying the table.

     ‘C-c }’
          Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

   Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated
with the field, because that is stored in a different line—the ‘TBLFM’
keyword line.  During the next recalculation, the field will be filled
again.  To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty
reply when prompted for the formula, or to edit the ‘TBLFM’ keyword.

   You may edit the ‘TBLFM’ keyword directly and re-apply the changed
equations with ‘C-c C-c’ in that line or with the normal recalculation
commands in the table.

Using multiple ‘TBLFM’ lines
............................

You may apply the formula temporarily.  This is useful when you want to
switch the formula applied to the table.  Place multiple ‘TBLFM’
keywords right after the table, and then press ‘C-c C-c’ on the formula
to apply.  Here is an example:

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 |   |
     | 2 |   |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

Pressing ‘C-c C-c’ in the line of ‘#+TBLFM: $2=$1*2’ yields:

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 | 2 |
     | 2 | 4 |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

If you recalculate this table, with ‘C-u C-c *’, for example, you get
the following result from applying only the first ‘TBLFM’ keyword.

     | x | y |
     |---+---|
     | 1 | 1 |
     | 2 | 2 |
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
     #+TBLFM: $2=$1*2

Debugging formulas
..................

When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string ‘#ERROR’.  If you would like to see what is going on
during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the Tbl menu and repeat the calculation,
for example by pressing ‘C-u C-u C-c = <RET>’ in a field.  Detailed
information are displayed.


File: org,  Node: Updating the table,  Next: Advanced features,  Prev: Editing and debugging formulas,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.9 Updating the table
------------------------

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  To make recalculation at least semi-automatic,
see *note Advanced features::.

   In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use
the following commands:

‘C-c *’ (‘org-table-recalculate’)
     Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column
     formulas from left to right, and all field/range formulas in the
     current row.

‘C-u C-c *’ or ‘C-u C-c C-c’
     Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the
     first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the
     table header.

‘C-u C-u C-c *’ or ‘C-u C-u C-c C-c’ (‘org-table-iterate’)
     Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
     This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of
     other fields that are computed _later_ in the calculation sequence.

‘M-x org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables’
     Recompute all tables in the current buffer.

‘M-x org-table-iterate-buffer-tables’
     Iterate all tables in the current buffer, in order to converge
     table-to-table dependencies.


File: org,  Node: Advanced features,  Prev: Updating the table,  Up: The Spreadsheet

3.5.10 Advanced features
------------------------

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign _names_(1) to fields and columns, you need
to reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.

‘C-#’ (‘org-table-rotate-recalc-marks’)
     Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states ‘#’,
     ‘*’, ‘!’, ‘$’.  When there is an active region, change all marks in
     the region.

   Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students
and makes use of these features:

     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
     | # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
     | ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
     | # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Average |        |        |        |  25.0 |      |
     | ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
     | $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     #+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f

     Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating
     the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or
     ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.
     The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

   The marking characters have the following meaning:

‘!’
     The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you
     may refer to a column as ‘$Tot’ instead of ‘$6’.

‘^’
     This row defines names for the fields _above_ the row.  With such a
     definition, any formula in the table may use ‘$m1’ to refer to the
     value ‘10’.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it is
     stored as ‘$name = ...’.

‘_’
     Similar to ‘^’, but defines names for the fields in the row
     _below_.

‘$’
     Fields in this row can define _parameters_ for formulas.  For
     example, if a field in a ‘$’ row contains ‘max=50’, then formulas
     in this table can refer to the value 50 using ‘$max’.  Parameters
     work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a
     per-table basis.

‘#’
     Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
     ‘<TAB>’ or ‘<RET>’ or ‘S-<TAB>’ in this row.  Also, this row is
     selected for a global recalculation with ‘C-u C-c *’.  Unmarked
     lines are left alone by this command.

‘*’
     Selects this line for global recalculation with ‘C-u C-c *’, but
     not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
     recalculation slows down editing too much.

‘/’
     Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
     narrowing ‘<N>’ markers or column group markers.

   Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic Calc package, here is a table that computes the Taylor series
of degree n at location x for a couple of functions.

     |---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
     |   | Func        | n | x   | Result                               |

3.6 Org Plot
============

Org Plot can produce graphs of information stored in Org tables, either
graphically or in ASCII art.

Graphical plots using Gnuplot
-----------------------------

Org Plot can produce 2D and 3D graphs of information stored in Org
tables using Gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/) and Gnuplot mode
(http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html).  To see
this in action, ensure that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot mode
installed on your system, then call ‘C-c " g’ or ‘M-x org-plot/gnuplot’
on the following table.

     #+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]"
     | Sede      | Max cites | H-index |
     |-----------+-----------+---------|
     | Chile     |    257.72 |   21.39 |
     | Leeds     |    165.77 |   19.68 |
     | Sao Paolo |     71.00 |   11.50 |
     | Stockholm |    134.19 |   14.33 |
     | Morelia   |    257.56 |   17.67 |

   Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table’s headers as
labels.  Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance
of plots can be exercised through the ‘PLOT’ keyword preceding a table.
See below for a complete list of Org Plot options.  For more information
and examples see the Org Plot tutorial
(https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html).

Plot options
............

‘set’
     Specify any Gnuplot option to be set when graphing.

‘title’
     Specify the title of the plot.

‘ind’
     Specify which column of the table to use as the ‘x’ axis.

‘deps’
     Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list, surrounded by
     parentheses and separated by spaces for example ‘dep:(3 4)’ to
     graph the third and fourth columns.  Defaults to graphing all other
     columns aside from the ‘ind’ column.

‘type’
     Specify whether the plot is ‘2d’, ‘3d’, or ‘grid’.

‘with’
     Specify a ‘with’ option to be inserted for every column being
     plotted, e.g., ‘lines’, ‘points’, ‘boxes’, ‘impulses’.  Defaults to
     ‘lines’.

‘file’
     If you want to plot to a file, specify
     ‘"path/to/desired/output-file"’.

‘labels’
     List of labels to be used for the ‘deps’.  Defaults to the column
     headers if they exist.

‘line’
     Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.

‘map’
     When plotting ‘3d’ or ‘grid’ types, set this to ‘t’ to graph a flat
     mapping rather than a ‘3d’ slope.

‘timefmt’
     Specify format of Org mode timestamps as they will be parsed by
     Gnuplot.  Defaults to ‘%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S’.

‘script’
     If you want total control, you can specify a script file—place the
     file name between double-quotes—which will be used to plot.  Before
     plotting, every instance of ‘$datafile’ in the specified script
     will be replaced with the path to the generated data file.  Note:
     even if you set this option, you may still want to specify the plot
     type, as that can impact the content of the data file.

ASCII bar plots
---------------

While point is on a column, typing ‘C-c `` a’ or ‘M-x orgtbl-ascii-plot’
create a new column containing an ASCII-art bars plot.  The plot is
implemented through a regular column formula.  When the source column
changes, the bar plot may be updated by refreshing the table, for
example typing ‘C-u C-c *’.

     #+TBLFM: $3='(orgtbl-ascii-draw $2 0.0 257.72 12)

   The formula is an Elisp call.

 -- Function: orgtbl-ascii-draw value min max &optional width
     Draw an ASCII bar in a table.

     VALUE is the value to plot.

     MIN is the value displayed as an empty bar.  MAX is the value
     filling all the WIDTH.  Sources values outside this range are
     displayed as ‘too small’ or ‘too large’.

     WIDTH is the number of characters of the bar plot.  It defaults to
     ‘12’.

4.1 Link Format
===============

Org recognizes plain URL-like links and activate them as clickable
links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

     [[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]

or alternatively

     [[LINK]]

   Once a link in the buffer is complete—all brackets present—, Org
changes the display so that ‘DESCRIPTION’ is displayed instead of
‘[[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]’ and ‘LINK’ is displayed instead of ‘[[LINK]]’.
Links are highlighted in the ‘org-link’ face, which, by default, is an
underlined face.

   You can directly edit the visible part of a link.  This can be either
the LINK part, if there is no description, or the DESCRIPTION part
otherwise.  To also edit the invisible LINK part, use ‘C-c C-l’ with
point on the link (see *note Handling Links::).

   If you place point at the beginning or just behind the end of the
displayed text and press ‘<BS>’, you remove the—invisible—bracket at
that location(1).  This makes the link incomplete and the internals are
again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the missing bracket hides the
link internals again.  To show the internal structure of all links, use
the menu: Org → Hyperlinks → Literal links.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) More accurately, the precise behavior depends on how point
arrived there—see *note Invisible Text: (elisp)Invisible Text.

4.2 Internal Links
==================

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal in
the current file.  The most important case is a link like
‘[[#my-custom-id]]’ which links to the entry with the ‘CUSTOM_ID’
property ‘my-custom-id’.  You are responsible yourself to make sure
these custom IDs are unique in a file.

   Links such as ‘[[My Target]]’ or ‘[[My Target][Find my target]]’ lead
to a text search in the current file.

   The link can be followed with ‘C-c C-o’ when point is on the link, or
with a mouse click (see *note Handling Links::).  Links to custom IDs
point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for a text
link is a _dedicated target_: the same string in double angular
brackets, like ‘<<My Target>>’.

   If no dedicated target exists, the link tries to match the exact name
of an element within the buffer.  Naming is done with the ‘NAME’
keyword, which has to be put in the line before the element it refers
to, as in the following example

     #+NAME: My Target
     | a  | table      |
     |----+------------|
     | of | four cells |

   If none of the above succeeds, Org searches for a headline that is
exactly the link text but may also include a TODO keyword and tags(1).

   During export, internal links are used to mark objects and assign
them a number.  Marked objects are then referenced by links pointing to
them.  In particular, links without a description appear as the number
assigned to the marked object(2).  In the following excerpt from an Org
buffer

     1. one item
     2. <<target>>another item
     Here we refer to item [[target]].

The last sentence will appear as ‘Here we refer to item 2’ when
exported.

   In non-Org files, the search looks for the words in the link text.
In the above example the search would be for ‘target’.

   Following a link pushes a mark onto Org’s own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with ‘C-c &’.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can
be used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the
buffer and press ‘M-<TAB>’.  All headlines in the current buffer are
offered as completions.

   (2) When targeting a ‘NAME’ keyword, the ‘CAPTION’ keyword is
mandatory in order to get proper numbering (see *note Captions::).

4.3 Radio Targets
=================

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in
normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target ‘<<<My
Target>>>’ causes each occurrence of ‘my target’ in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned automatically for
radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To update
the target list during editing, press ‘C-c C-c’ with point on or at a
target.

4.4 External Links
==================

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after the
colon.  The following list shows examples for each link type.

‘http://www.astro.uva.nl/=dominik’          on the web

‘/home/dominik/images/jupiter.jpg’          same as above
‘file:papers/last.pdf’                      file, relative path
‘./papers/last.pdf’                         same as above
‘file:/ssh:me@some.where:papers/last.pdf’   file, path on remote machine

‘file+emacs:/path/to/file’                  force opening by Emacs
‘docview:papers/last.pdf::NNN’              open in doc-view mode at page
‘id:B7423F4D-2E8A-471B-8810-C40F074717E9’   link to heading by ID
‘news:comp.emacs’                           Usenet link
‘mailto:adent@galaxy.net’                   mail link
‘mhe:folder’                                MH-E folder link
‘mhe:folder#id’                             MH-E message link
‘rmail:folder’                              Rmail folder link
‘rmail:folder#id’                           Rmail message link
‘gnus:group’                                Gnus group link
‘gnus:group#id’                             Gnus article link
‘bbdb:R.*Stallman’                          BBDB link (with regexp)
‘irc:/irc.com/#emacs/bob’                   IRC link
‘info:org#External links’                   Info node link
‘shell:ls *.org’                            shell command
‘elisp:org-agenda’                          interactive Elisp command
‘elisp:(find-file "Elisp.org")’             Elisp form to evaluate

   On top of these built-in link types, additional ones are available
through the ‘contrib/’ directory (see *note Installation::).  For
example, these links to VM or Wanderlust messages are available when you
load the corresponding libraries from the ‘contrib/’ directory:

‘vm:folder’                              VM folder link
‘vm:folder#id’                           VM message link
‘vm://myself@some.where.org/folder#id’   VM on remote machine
‘vm-imap:account:folder’                 VM IMAP folder link
‘vm-imap:account:folder#id’              VM IMAP message link
‘wl:folder’                              Wanderlust folder link
‘wl:folder#id’                           Wanderlust message link

   For information on customizing Org to add new link types, see *note
Adding Hyperlink Types::.

   A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the URL (see *note Link
Format::), for example:

     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

   If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image,
HTML export (see *note HTML Export::) inlines the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image, that image is inlined into the exported HTML file.

   Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
‘bbdb:Richard Stallman’), or if you need to remove ambiguities about the
end of the link, enclose the link in square or angular brackets.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The actual behavior of the search depends on the value of the
variable ‘org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline’.  If its value is
‘nil’, then a fuzzy text search is done.  If it is ‘t’, then only the
exact headline is matched, ignoring spaces and statistic cookies.  If
the value is ‘query-to-create’, then an exact headline is searched; if
it is not found, then the user is queried to create it.

4.5 Handling Links
==================

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to insert
it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

   The main function is ‘org-store-link’, called with ‘M-x
org-store-link’.  Because of its importance, we suggest to bind it to a
widely available key (see *note Activation::).  It stores a link to the
current location.  The link is stored for later insertion into an Org
buffer—see below.  The kind of link that is created depends on the
current buffer:

_Org mode buffers_
     For Org files, if there is a ‘<<target>>’ at point, the link points
     to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current headline, which
     is also the description(1).

     If the headline has a ‘CUSTOM_ID’ property, store a link to this
     custom ID.  In addition or alternatively, depending on the value of
     ‘org-link-to-org-use-id’, create and/or use a globally unique ‘ID’
     property for the link(2).  So using this command in Org buffers
     potentially creates two links: a human-readable link from the
     custom ID, and one that is globally unique and works even if the
     entry is moved from file to file.  Later, when inserting the link,
     you need to decide which one to use.

_Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus_
     Pretty much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link points
     to the current article, or, in some Gnus buffers, to the group.
     The description is constructed according to the variable
     ‘org-email-link-description-format’.  By default, it refers to the
     addressee and the subject, possibly truncated.

_Web browsers: W3, W3M and EWW_
     Here the link is the current URL, with the page title as the
     description.

_Contacts: BBDB_
     Links created in a BBDB buffer point to the current entry.

_Chat: IRC_
     For IRC links, if the variable ‘org-irc-link-to-logs’ is non-‘nil’,
     create a ‘file’ style link to the relevant point in the logs for
     the current conversation.  Otherwise store an ‘irc’ style link to
     the user/channel/server under the point.

_Other files_
     For any other file, the link points to the file, with a search
     string (see *note Search Options::) pointing to the contents of the
     current line.  If there is an active region, the selected words
     form the basis of the search string.  You can write custom Lisp
     functions to select the search string and perform the search for
     particular file types (see *note Custom Searches::).

     You can also define dedicated links to other files.  See *note
     Adding Hyperlink Types::.

_Agenda view_
     When point is in an agenda view, the created link points to the
     entry referenced by the current line.

   From an Org buffer, the following commands create, navigate or, more
generally, act on links.

‘C-c C-l’ (‘org-insert-link’)
     Insert a link(3).  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, using text for an internal link,
     or one of the link type prefixes mentioned in the examples above.
     The link is inserted into the buffer, along with a descriptive
     text(4).  If some text was selected at this time, it becomes the
     default description.

     _Inserting stored links_
          All links stored during the current session are part of the
          history for this prompt, so you can access them with ‘<UP>’
          and ‘<DOWN>’ (or ‘M-p’, ‘M-n’).

     _Completion support_
          Completion with ‘<TAB>’ helps you to insert valid link
          prefixes like ‘http’ or ‘ftp’, including the prefixes defined
          through link abbreviations (see *note Link Abbreviations::).
          If you press ‘<RET>’ after inserting only the prefix, Org
          offers specific completion support for some link types(5).
          For example, if you type ‘f i l e <RET>’—alternative access:
          ‘C-u C-c C-l’, see below—Org offers file name completion, and
          after ‘b b d b <RET>’ you can complete contact names.

‘C-u C-c C-l’
     When ‘C-c C-l’ is called with a ‘C-u’ prefix argument, insert a
     link to a file.  You may use file name completion to select the
     name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted relative to the
     directory of the current Org file, if the linked file is in the
     current directory or in a sub-directory of it, or if the path is
     written relative to the current directory using ‘../’.  Otherwise
     an absolute path is used, if possible with ‘~/’ for your home
     directory.  You can force an absolute path with two ‘C-u’ prefixes.

‘C-c C-l’ (with point on existing link)
     When point is on an existing link, ‘C-c C-l’ allows you to edit the
     link and description parts of the link.

‘C-c C-o’ (‘org-open-at-point’)
     Open link at point.  This launches a web browser for URL (using
     ‘browse-url-at-point’), run VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for
     the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
     When point is on an internal link, this command runs the
     corresponding search.  When point is on the tags part of a
     headline, it creates the corresponding tags view (see *note
     Matching tags and properties::).  If point is on a timestamp, it
     compiles the agenda for that date.  Furthermore, it visits text and
     remote files in ‘file’ links with Emacs and select a suitable
     application for local non-text files.  Classification of files is
     based on file extension only.  See option ‘org-file-apps’.  If you
     want to override the default application and visit the file with
     Emacs, use a ‘C-u’ prefix.  If you want to avoid opening in Emacs,
     use a ‘C-u C-u’ prefix.

     If point is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all links in
     the headline and entry text.  If you want to setup the frame
     configuration for following links, customize
     ‘org-link-frame-setup’.

‘<RET>’
     When ‘org-return-follows-link’ is set, ‘<RET>’ also follows the
     link at point.

‘mouse-2’ or ‘mouse-1’
     On links, ‘mouse-1’ and ‘mouse-2’ opens the link just as ‘C-c C-o’
     does.

‘mouse-3’
     Like ‘mouse-2’, but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
     internal links to be displayed in another window(6).

‘C-c %’ (‘org-mark-ring-push’)
     Push the current position onto the Org mark ring, to be able to
     return easily.  Commands following an internal link do this
     automatically.

‘C-c &’ (‘org-mark-ring-goto’)
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by ‘C-c %’.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.

‘C-c C-x C-n’ (‘org-next-link’)
‘C-c C-x C-p’ (‘org-previous-link’)
     Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the limit
     of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.  The
     key bindings for this are really too long; you might want to bind
     this also to ‘M-n’ and ‘M-p’.

          (add-hook 'org-load-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (define-key org-mode-map "\M-n" 'org-next-link)
                      (define-key org-mode-map "\M-p" 'org-previous-link)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the headline contains a timestamp, it is removed from the
link, which results in a wrong link—you should avoid putting a timestamp
in the headline.

   (2) The Org Id library must first be loaded, either through
‘org-customize’, by enabling ‘id’ in ‘org-modules’, or by adding
‘(require 'org-id)’ in your Emacs init file.

   (3) Note that you do not have to use this command to insert a link.
Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them straight
into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.

   (4) After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed from
the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list for later use, use a
triple ‘C-u’ prefix argument to ‘C-c C-l’, or configure the option
‘org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion’.

   (5) This works if a function has been defined in the ‘:complete’
property of a link in ‘org-link-parameters’.

   (6) See the variable
‘org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer’.

4.6 Using Links Outside Org
===========================

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org,
but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, Org provides two functions:
‘org-insert-link-global’ and ‘org-open-at-point-global’.

   You might want to bind them to globally available keys.  See *note
Activation:: for some advice.


File: org,  Node: Link Abbreviations,  Next: Search Options,  Prev: Using Links Outside Org,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.7 Link Abbreviations
======================

Long URL can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

     [[linkword:tag][description]]

where the tag is optional.  The _linkword_ must be a word, starting with
a letter, followed by letters, numbers, ‘-’, and ‘_’.  Abbreviations are
resolved according to the information in the variable
‘org-link-abbrev-alist’ that relates the linkwords to replacement text.
Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
           '(("bugzilla"  . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
             ("url-to-ja" . "http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=en&tl=ja&u=%h")
             ("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
             ("gmap"      . "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
             ("omap"      . "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=%s&polygon=1")
             ("ads"       . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string ‘%s’, it is replaced with
the tag.  Using ‘%h’ instead of ‘%s’ percent-encodes the tag (see the
example above, where we need to encode the URL parameter).  Using
‘%(my-function)’ passes the tag to a custom Lisp function, and replace
it by the resulting string.

   If the replacement text do not contain any specifier, it is simply
appended to the string in order to create the link.

   Instead of a string, you may also specify a Lisp function to create
the link.  Such a function will be called with the tag as the only
argument.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
‘[[bugzilla:129]]’, search the web for ‘OrgMode’ with
‘[[google:OrgMode]]’, show the map location of the Free Software
Foundation ‘[[gmap:51 Franklin Street, Boston]]’ or of Carsten office
‘[[omap:Science Park 904, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]’ and find out
what the Org author is doing besides Emacs hacking with
‘[[ads:Dominik,C]]’.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

   In-buffer completion (see *note Completion::) can be used after ‘[’
to complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a Lisp function
that implements special (e.g., completion) support for inserting such a
link with ‘C-c C-l’.  Such a function should not accept any arguments,
and should return the full link with a prefix.  You can set the link
completion function like this:

     (org-link-set-parameter "type" :complete #'some-completion-function)


File: org,  Node: Search Options,  Next: Custom Searches,  Prev: Link Abbreviations,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.8 Search Options in File Links
================================

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double colon(1).  For example,
when the command ‘org-store-link’ creates a link (see *note Handling
Links::) to a file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search
string that can be used to find this line back later when following the
link with ‘C-c C-o’.

   Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with explanations for each:

     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

‘255’
     Jump to line 255.

‘My Target’
     Search for a link target ‘<<My Target>>’, or do a text search for
     ‘my target’, similar to the search in internal links, see *note
     Internal Links::.  In HTML export (see *note HTML Export::), such a
     file link becomes a HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

‘*My Target’
     In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

‘#my-custom-id’
     Link to a heading with a ‘CUSTOM_ID’ property

‘/REGEXP/’
     Do a regular expression search for REGEXP.  This uses the Emacs
     command ‘occur’ to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org mode, ‘org-occur’ is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.

   As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, ‘[[file:::find me]]’ does a
search for ‘find me’ in the current file, just as ‘[[find me]]’ would.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a single
colon.


File: org,  Node: Custom Searches,  Prev: Search Options,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.9 Custom Searches
===================

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
‘year="1993"’ which would not result in good search strings, because the
only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the citation key.

   If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using ‘add-hook’, these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
‘org-create-file-search-functions’ and
‘org-execute-file-search-functions’.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism for
BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  See the file ‘org-bibtex.el’.


File: org,  Node: TODO Items,  Next: Tags,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Top

5 TODO Items
************

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents(1).
Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because TODO
items usually come up while taking notes!  With Org mode, simply mark
any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way, information is
not duplicated, and the entire context from which the TODO item emerged
is always present.

   Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

* Menu:

* TODO Basics::                  Marking and displaying TODO entries.
* TODO Extensions::              Workflow and assignments.

5.1 Basic TODO Functionality
============================

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word ‘TODO’,
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

   The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

‘C-c C-t’ (‘org-todo’)
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     If TODO keywords have fast access keys (see *note Fast access to
     TODO states::), prompt for a TODO keyword through the fast
     selection interface; this is the default behavior when
     ‘org-use-fast-todo-selection’ is non-‘nil’.

     The same rotation can also be done “remotely” from the agenda
     buffer with the ‘t’ command key (see *note Agenda Commands::).

‘C-u C-c C-t’
     When TODO keywords have no selection keys, select a specific
     keyword using completion; otherwise force cycling through TODO
     states with no prompt.  When ‘org-use-fast-todo-selection’ is set
     to ‘prefix’, use the fast selection interface.

‘S-<RIGHT>’ ‘S-<LEFT>’
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Useful mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (see *note
     TODO Extensions::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion
     of the interaction with ‘shift-selection-mode’.  See also the
     variable ‘org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change’.

‘C-c / t’ (‘org-show-todo-tree’)
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (see *note Sparse Trees::).
     Folds the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items—with not-DONE
     state—and the headings hierarchy above them.  With a prefix
     argument, or by using ‘C-c / T’, search for a specific TODO.  You
     are prompted for the keyword, and you can also give a list of
     keywords like ‘KWD1|KWD2|...’ to list entries that match any one of
     these keywords.  With a numeric prefix argument N, show the tree
     for the Nth keyword in the variable ‘org-todo-keywords’.  With two
     prefix arguments, find all TODO states, both un-done and done.

‘M-x org-agenda t’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items (with not-DONE
     states) from all agenda files (see *note Agenda Views::) into a
     single buffer.  The new buffer is in Org Agenda mode, which
     provides commands to examine and manipulate the TODO entries from
     the new buffer (see *note Agenda Commands::).  See *note Global
     TODO list::, for more information.

‘S-M-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

   Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the
docstring of the option ‘org-todo-state-tags-triggers’ for details.

5.2 Extended Use of TODO Keywords
=================================

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with _TODO keywords_ (stored in ‘org-todo-keywords’).  With special
setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

   Note that _tags_ are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (see *note Tags::).

* Menu:

* Workflow states::              From TODO to DONE in steps.
* TODO types::                   I do this, Fred does the rest.
* Multiple sets in one file::    Mixing it all, still finding your way.
* Fast access to TODO states::   Single letter selection of state.
* Per-file keywords::            Different files, different requirements.
* Faces for TODO keywords::      Highlighting states.
* TODO dependencies::            When one task needs to wait for others.


File: org,  Node: Workflow states,  Next: TODO types,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.1 TODO keywords as workflow states
--------------------------------------

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different _sequential_ states in
the process of working on an item, for example(1):

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

   The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that _need
action_) from the DONE states (which need _no further action_).  If you
do not provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.

   With this setup, the command ‘C-c C-t’ cycles an entry from ‘TODO’ to
‘FEEDBACK’, then to ‘VERIFY’, and finally to ‘DONE’ and ‘DELEGATED’.
You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific
state.  For example ‘C-3 C-c C-t’ changes the state immediately to
‘VERIFY’.  Or you can use ‘S-<LEFT>’ to go backward through the
sequence.  If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion
(see *note Completion::) or even a special one-key selection scheme (see
*note Fast access to TODO states::) to insert these words into the
buffer.  Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see *note
Tracking TODO state changes::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Changing the variable ‘org-todo-keywords’ only becomes effective
after restarting Org mode in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: TODO types,  Next: Multiple sets in one file,  Prev: Workflow states,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.2 TODO keywords as types
----------------------------

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
_types_ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate that
items are for “work” or “home”.  Or, when you work with several people
on a single project, you might want to assign action items directly to
persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would be set up
like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))

   In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but
rather different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a
task to a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this
style by adapting the workings of the command ‘C-c C-t’(1).  When used
several times in succession, it still cycles through all names, in order
to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return to the
item after some time and execute ‘C-c C-t’ again, it will switch from
any name directly to ‘DONE’.  Use prefix arguments or completion to
quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the items of a
specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to ‘C-c /
t’.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use ‘C-3
C-c / t’.  To collect Lucy’s items from all agenda files into a single
buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument as well when creating
the global TODO list: ‘C-3 M-x org-agenda t’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is also true for the ‘t’ command in the agenda buffer.


File: org,  Node: Multiple sets in one file,  Next: Fast access to TODO states,  Prev: TODO types,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic TODO/DONE, but
also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating that an
item has been canceled—so it is not DONE, but also does not require
action.  Your setup would then look like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))

   The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this setup,
‘C-c C-t’ only operates within a sub-sequence, so it switches from
‘DONE’ to (nothing) to ‘TODO’, and from ‘FIXED’ to (nothing) to
‘REPORT’.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the
correct sequence.  In addition to typing a keyword or using completion
(see *note Completion::), you may also apply the following commands:

‘C-u C-u C-c C-t’
‘C-S-<RIGHT>’
‘C-S-<LEFT>’
     These keys jump from one TODO sub-sequence to the next.  In the
     above example, ‘C-u C-u C-c C-t’ or ‘C-S-<RIGHT>’ would jump from
     ‘TODO’ or ‘DONE’ to ‘REPORT’, and any of the words in the second
     row to ‘CANCELED’.  Note that the ‘C-S-’ key binding conflict with
     ‘shift-selection-mode’ (see *note Conflicts::).

‘S-<RIGHT>’
‘S-<LEFT>’
     ‘S-<LEFT>’ and ‘S-<RIGHT>’ walk through _all_ keywords from all
     sub-sequences, so for example ‘S-<RIGHT>’ would switch from ‘DONE’
     to ‘REPORT’ in the example above.  For a discussion of the
     interaction with ‘shift-selection-mode’, see *note Conflicts::.

5.2.4 Fast access to TODO states
--------------------------------

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the
selection character after each keyword, in parentheses(1).  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))

   If you then press ‘C-c C-t’ followed by the selection key, the entry
is switched to this state.  ‘<SPC>’ can be used to remove any TODO
keyword from an entry(2).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) All characters are allowed except ‘@’, ‘^’ and ‘!’, which have a
special meaning here.

   (2) Check also the variable ‘org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo’, it
allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface (see
*note Setting Tags::), in case you like to mingle the two concepts.
Note that this means you need to come up with unique keys across both
sets of keywords.


File: org,  Node: Per-file keywords,  Next: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Fast access to TODO states,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.5 Setting up keywords for individual files
----------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

     #+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED

   You may also write ‘#+SEQ_TODO’ to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as ‘#+TODO’, or

     #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

   A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

     #+TODO: TODO | DONE
     #+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
     #+TODO: | CANCELED

   To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type ‘#+’ into the
buffer and then use ‘M-<TAB>’ to complete it (see *note Completion::).

   Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar—or the last keyword
if no bar is there—must always mean that the item is DONE, although you
may use a different word.  After changing one of these lines, use ‘C-c
C-c’ with point still in the line to make the changes known to Org
mode(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode parses these lines only when Org mode is activated after
visiting a file.  ‘C-c C-c’ with point in a line starting with ‘#+’ is
simply restarting Org mode for the current buffer.


File: org,  Node: Faces for TODO keywords,  Next: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Per-file keywords,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.6 Faces for TODO keywords
-----------------------------

Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: ‘org-todo’ for
keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
‘org-done’ for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If you are
using more than two different states, you might want to use special
faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
‘org-todo-keyword-faces’.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("TODO" . org-warning) ("STARTED" . "yellow")
             ("CANCELED" . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))

   While using a list with face properties as shown for ‘CANCELED’
_should_ work, this does not always seem to be the case.  If necessary,
define a special face and use that.  A string is interpreted as a color.
The variable ‘org-faces-easy-properties’ determines if that color is
interpreted as a foreground or a background color.


File: org,  Node: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Faces for TODO keywords,  Up: TODO Extensions

5.2.7 TODO dependencies
-----------------------

The structure of Org files—hierarchy and lists—makes it easy to define
TODO dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be marked
DONE until all TODO subtasks, or children tasks, are marked as DONE.
Sometimes there is a logical sequence to (sub)tasks, so that one subtask
cannot be acted upon before all siblings above it have been marked DONE.
If you customize the variable ‘org-enforce-todo-dependencies’, Org
blocks entries from changing state to DONE while they have TODO children
that are not DONE.  Furthermore, if an entry has a property ‘ORDERED’,
each of its TODO children is blocked until all earlier siblings are
marked DONE.  Here is an example:

     * TODO Blocked until (two) is done
     ** DONE one
     ** TODO two

     * Parent
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ORDERED:  t
     :END:
     ** TODO a
     ** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
     ** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)

   You can ensure an entry is never blocked by using the ‘NOBLOCKING’
property (see *note Properties and Columns::):

     * This entry is never blocked
     :PROPERTIES:
     :NOBLOCKING: t
     :END:

‘C-c C-x o’ (‘org-toggle-ordered-property’)
     Toggle the ‘ORDERED’ property of the current entry.  A property is
     used for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited from entries above like a tag (see *note
     Tags::).  However, if you would like to _track_ the value of this
     property with a tag for better visibility, customize the variable
     ‘org-track-ordered-property-with-tag’.

‘C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t’
     Change TODO state, regardless of any state blocking.

   If you set the variable ‘org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks’, TODO entries
that cannot be marked DONE because of unmarked children are shown in a
dimmed font or even made invisible in agenda views (see *note Agenda
Views::).

   You can also block changes of TODO states by using checkboxes (see
*note Checkboxes::).  If you set the variable
‘org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies’, an entry that has unchecked
checkboxes is blocked from switching to DONE.

   If you need more complex dependency structures, for example
dependencies between entries in different trees or files, check out the
contributed module ‘org-depend.el’.

5.3 Progress Logging
====================

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and optionally a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable, settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see *note Clocking
Work Time::.

* Menu:

* Closing items::                When was this entry marked DONE?
* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?
* Tracking your habits::         How consistent have you been?


File: org,  Node: Closing items,  Next: Tracking TODO state changes,  Up: Progress Logging

5.3.1 Closing items
-------------------

The most basic logging is to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item
was marked DONE.  This can be achieved with(1)

     (setq org-log-done 'time)

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any
of the DONE states, a line ‘CLOSED: [timestamp]’ is inserted just after
the headline.  If you turn the entry back into a TODO item through
further state cycling, that line is removed again.  If you turn the
entry back to a non-TODO state (by pressing ‘C-c C-t <SPC>’ for
example), that line is also removed, unless you set
‘org-closed-keep-when-no-todo’ to non-‘nil’.  If you want to record a
note along with the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done 'note)

You are then be prompted for a note, and that note is stored below the
entry with a ‘Closing Note’ heading.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ‘#+STARTUP: logdone’.

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ‘#+STARTUP: lognotedone’.


File: org,  Node: Tracking TODO state changes,  Next: Tracking your habits,  Prev: Closing items,  Up: Progress Logging

5.3.2 Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------------

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (see *note *Workflow
states: Workflow states.), you might want to keep track of when a state
change occurred and maybe take a note about this change.  You can either
record just a timestamp, or a time-stamped note.  These records are
inserted after the headline as an itemized list, newest first(1).  When
taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the way
into a drawer (see *note Drawers::).  Customize the variable
‘org-log-into-drawer’ to get this behavior—the recommended drawer for
this is called ‘LOGBOOK’(2).  You can also overrule the setting of this
variable for a subtree by setting a ‘LOG_INTO_DRAWER’ property.

   Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org
mode expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is
achieved by adding special markers ‘!’ (for a timestamp) or ‘@’ (for a
note with timestamp) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example,
with the setting

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))

to record a timestamp without a note for TODO keywords configured with
‘@’, just type ‘C-c C-c’ to enter a blank note when prompted.

   You not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but
also request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to ‘DONE’,
and that a note is recorded when switching to ‘WAIT’ or ‘CANCELED’(3).
The setting for ‘WAIT’ is even more special: the ‘!’ after the slash
means that in addition to the note taken when entering the state, a
timestamp should be recorded when _leaving_ the ‘WAIT’ state, if and
only if the _target_ state does not configure logging for entering it.
So it has no effect when switching from ‘WAIT’ to ‘DONE’, because ‘DONE’
is configured to record a timestamp only.  But when switching from
‘WAIT’ back to ‘TODO’, the ‘/!’ in the ‘WAIT’ setting now triggers a
timestamp even though ‘TODO’ has no logging configured.

   You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences
local to a buffer:

     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

   In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a ‘LOGGING’ property in this entry.  Any non-empty
‘LOGGING’ property resets all logging settings to ‘nil’.  You may then
turn on logging for this specific tree using ‘STARTUP’ keywords like
‘lognotedone’ or ‘logrepeat’, as well as adding state specific settings
like ‘TODO(!)’.  For example:

     * TODO Log each state with only a time
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
       :END:
     * TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
       :END:
     * TODO No logging at all
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: nil
       :END:

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable ‘org-log-states-order-reversed’.

   (2) Note that the ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer is unfolded when pressing ‘<SPC>’
in the agenda to show an entry—use ‘C-u <SPC>’ to keep it folded here.

   (3) It is possible that Org mode records two timestamps when you are
using both ‘org-log-done’ and state change logging.  However, it never
prompts for two notes: if you have configured both, the state change
recording note takes precedence and cancel the closing note.


File: org,  Node: Tracking your habits,  Prev: Tracking TODO state changes,  Up: Progress Logging

5.3.3 Tracking your habits
--------------------------

Org has the ability to track the consistency of a special category of
TODO, called “habits.” To use habits, you have to enable the ‘habits’
module by customizing the variable ‘org-modules’.

   A habit has the following properties:

  1. The habit is a TODO item, with a TODO keyword representing an open
     state.

  2. The property ‘STYLE’ is set to the value ‘habit’ (see *note
     Properties and Columns::).

  3. The TODO has a scheduled date, usually with a ‘.+’ style repeat
     interval.  A ‘++’ style may be appropriate for habits with time
     constraints, e.g., must be done on weekends, or a ‘+’ style for an
     unusual habit that can have a backlog, e.g., weekly reports.

  4. The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified by
     using the syntax ‘.+2d/3d’, which says that you want to do the task
     at least every three days, but at most every two days.

  5. State logging for the DONE state is enabled (see *note Tracking
     TODO state changes::), in order for historical data to be
     represented in the consistency graph.  If it is not enabled it is
     not an error, but the consistency graphs are largely meaningless.

   To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in action,
here’s an actual habit with some history:

     ** TODO Shave
        SCHEDULED: <2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d>
        :PROPERTIES:
        :STYLE:    habit
        :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
        :END:
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-12 Mon]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-10 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-04 Sun]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-02 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-29 Tue]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-25 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-19 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-16 Wed]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-12 Sat]

   What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days—given
by the ‘SCHEDULED’ date and repeat interval—and at least every 4 days.
If today is the 15th, then the habit first appears in the agenda (see
*note Agenda Views::) on Oct 17, after the minimum of 2 days has
elapsed, and will appear overdue on Oct 19, after four days have
elapsed.

   What’s really useful about habits is that they are displayed along
with a consistency graph, to show how consistent you’ve been at getting
that task done in the past.  This graph shows every day that the task
was done over the past three weeks, with colors for each day.  The
colors used are:

Blue
     If the task was not to be done yet on that day.
Green
     If the task could have been done on that day.
Yellow
     If the task was going to be overdue the next day.
Red
     If the task was overdue on that day.

   In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with an
asterisk if the task was actually done that day, and an exclamation mark
to show where the current day falls in the graph.

   There are several configuration variables that can be used to change
the way habits are displayed in the agenda.

‘org-habit-graph-column’
     The buffer column at which the consistency graph should be drawn.
     This overwrites any text in that column, so it is a good idea to
     keep your habits’ titles brief and to the point.

‘org-habit-preceding-days’
     The amount of history, in days before today, to appear in
     consistency graphs.

‘org-habit-following-days’
     The number of days after today that appear in consistency graphs.

‘org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today’
     If non-‘nil’, only show habits in today’s agenda view.  The default
     value is ‘t’.

   Lastly, pressing ‘K’ in the agenda buffer causes habits to
temporarily be disabled and do not appear at all.  Press ‘K’ again to
bring them back.  They are also subject to tag filtering, if you have
habits which should only be done in certain contexts, for example.


File: org,  Node: Priorities,  Next: Breaking Down Tasks,  Prev: Progress Logging,  Up: TODO Items

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up with enough TODO items
that it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be
done by placing a _priority cookie_ into the headline of a TODO item,
like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

   By default, Org mode supports three priorities: ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’.
‘A’ is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is treated as
equivalent if it had priority ‘B’.  Priorities make a difference only
for sorting in the agenda (see *note Weekly/daily agenda::); outside the
agenda, they have no inherent meaning to Org mode.  The cookies are
displayed with the face defined by the variable ‘org-priority-faces’,
which can be customized.

   Priorities can be attached to any outline node; they do not need to
be TODO items.

‘C-c ,’ (‘org-priority’)
     Set the priority of the current headline.  The command prompts for
     a priority character ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’.  When you press ‘<SPC>’
     instead, the priority cookie, if one is set, is removed from the
     headline.  The priorities can also be changed “remotely” from the
     agenda buffer with the ‘,’ command (see *note Agenda Commands::).

‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-priority-up’)
‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-priority-down’)
     Increase/decrease the priority of the current headline(1).  Note
     that these keys are also used to modify timestamps (see *note
     Creating Timestamps::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a
     discussion of the interaction with ‘shift-selection-mode’.

   You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the
variables ‘org-highest-priority’, ‘org-lowest-priority’, and
‘org-default-priority’.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

     #+PRIORITIES: A C B

File: org,  Node: Breaking Down Tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO Items

5.5 Breaking Down Tasks into Subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree(1).  To keep an overview of the
fraction of subtasks that have already been marked DONE, insert either
‘[/]’ or ‘[%]’ anywhere in the headline.  These cookies are updated each
time the TODO status of a child changes, or when pressing ‘C-c C-c’ on
the cookie.  For example:

     * Organize Party [33%]
     ** TODO Call people [1/2]
     *** TODO Peter
     *** DONE Sarah
     ** TODO Buy food
     ** DONE Talk to neighbor

   If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the
meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
‘COOKIE_DATA’ to either ‘checkbox’ or ‘todo’ to resolve this issue.

   If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO
entries in the subtree (not just direct children), configure the
variable ‘org-hierarchical-todo-statistics’.  To do this for a single
subtree, include the word ‘recursive’ into the value of the
‘COOKIE_DATA’ property.

     * Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
       :PROPERTIES:
       :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
       :END:

   If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE when
all children are done, you can use the following setup:

     (defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
       "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
       (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
         (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

     (add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)

   Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy
of) a large number of subtasks (see *note Checkboxes::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the option
‘org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels’.


File: org,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking Down Tasks,  Up: TODO Items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list(1) (see *note Plain Lists::) can be made into
a checkbox by starting it with the string ‘[ ]’.  This feature is
similar to TODO items (see *note TODO Items::), but is more lightweight.
Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list, so they are often
great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use
them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use ‘C-c C-c’, or use
the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski’s ‘org-mouse.el’).

   Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [2/4]
       - [-] call people [1/3]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
         - [ ] Sam
       - [X] order food
       - [ ] think about what music to play
       - [X] talk to the neighbors

   Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes makes the
parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

   The ‘[2/4]’ and ‘[1/3]’ in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been checked
off, and the total number of checkboxes present.  This can give you an
idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded entry.
The cookies can be placed into a headline or into (the first line of) a
plain list item.  Each cookie covers checkboxes of direct children
structurally below the headline/item on which the cookie appears(2).
You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either ‘[/]’ or ‘[%]’.
With ‘[/]’ you get an ‘n out of m’ result, as in the examples above.
With ‘[%]’ you get information about the percentage of checkboxes
checked (in the above example, this would be ‘[50%]’ and ‘[33%]’,
respectively).  In a headline, a cookie can count either checkboxes
below the heading or TODO states of children, and it displays whatever
was changed last.  Set the property ‘COOKIE_DATA’ to either ‘checkbox’
or ‘todo’ to resolve this issue.

   If the current outline node has an ‘ORDERED’ property, checkboxes
must be checked off in sequence, and an error is thrown if you try to
check off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

   The following commands work with checkboxes:

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-toggle-checkbox’)
     Toggle checkbox status or—with prefix argument—checkbox presence at
     point.  With a single prefix argument, add an empty checkbox or
     remove the current one(3).  With a double prefix argument, set it
     to ‘[-]’, which is considered to be an intermediate state.

‘C-c C-x C-b’ (‘org-toggle-checkbox’)
     Toggle checkbox status or—with prefix argument—checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to ‘[-]’, which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.

        • If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in the
          region and set all remaining boxes to the same status as the
          first.  With a prefix argument, add or remove the checkbox for
          all items in the region.

        • If point is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the region
          between this headline and the next—so _not_ the entire
          subtree.

        • If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at
          point.

‘M-S-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-todo-heading’)
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if point is
     already in a plain list item (see *note Plain Lists::).

‘C-c C-x o’ (‘org-toggle-ordered-property’)
     Toggle the ‘ORDERED’ property of the entry, to toggle if checkboxes
     must be checked off in sequence.  A property is used for this
     behavior because this should be local to the current entry, not
     inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to _track_ the
     value of this property with a tag for better visibility, customize
     ‘org-track-ordered-property-with-tag’.

‘C-c #’ (‘org-update-statistics-cookies’)
     Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When
     called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
     statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle
     checkboxes with ‘C-c C-c’ and make new ones with ‘M-S-<RET>’.  TODO
     statistics cookies update when changing TODO states.  If you delete
     boxes/entries or add/change them by hand, use this command to get
     things back into sync.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) With the exception of description lists.  But you can allow it by
modifying ‘org-list-automatic-rules’ accordingly.

   (2) Set the variable ‘org-hierarchical-checkbox-statistics’ if you
want such cookies to count all checkboxes below the cookie, not just
those belonging to direct children.

   (3) ‘C-u C-c C-c’ on the _first_ item of a list with no checkbox adds
checkboxes to the rest of the list.

6 Tags
******

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign _tags_ to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, ‘_’,
and ‘@’.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
‘:work:’.  Several tags can be specified, as in ‘:work:urgent:’.  Tags
by default are in bold face with the same color as the headline.  You
may specify special faces for specific tags using the variable
‘org-tag-faces’, in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords (see
*note Faces for TODO keywords::).

* Menu:

* Tag Inheritance::              Tags use the tree structure of an outline.
* Setting Tags::                 How to assign tags to a headline.
* Tag Hierarchy::                Create a hierarchy of tags.
* Tag Searches::                 Searching for combinations of tags.


File: org,  Node: Tag Inheritance,  Next: Setting Tags,  Up: Tags

6.1 Tag Inheritance
===================

_Tags_ make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings inherit the tag as well.  For
example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading has the tags ‘work’, ‘boss’, ‘notes’, and ‘action’
even though the final heading is not explicitly marked with those tags.
You can also set tags that all entries in a file should inherit just as
if these tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero that surrounds
the entire file.  Use a line like this(1)

     #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

   To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, or to turn it off
entirely, use the variables ‘org-use-tag-inheritance’ and
‘org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance’.

   When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance is
turned on, all the sublevels in the same tree—for a simple match
form—match as well(2).  The list of matches may then become very long.
If you only want to see the first tags match in a subtree, configure the
variable ‘org-tags-match-list-sublevels’ (not recommended).

   Tag inheritance is relevant when the agenda search tries to match a
tag, either in the ‘tags’ or ‘tags-todo’ agenda types.  In other agenda
types, ‘org-use-tag-inheritance’ has no effect.  Still, you may want to
have your tags correctly set in the agenda, so that tag filtering works
fine, with inherited tags.  Set ‘org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance’ to
control this: the default value includes all agenda types, but setting
this to ‘nil’ can really speed up agenda generation.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing ‘C-c C-c’
activates any changes in the line.

   (2) This is only true if the search does not involve more complex
tests including properties (see *note Property Searches::).


File: org,  Node: Setting Tags,  Next: Tag Hierarchy,  Prev: Tag Inheritance,  Up: Tags

6.2 Setting Tags
================

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, ‘M-<TAB>’ offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

‘C-c C-q’ (‘org-set-tags-command’)
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode either offers
     completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see
     below.  After pressing ‘<RET>’, the tags are inserted and aligned
     to ‘org-tags-column’.  When called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, all tags in
     the current buffer are aligned to that column, just to make things
     look nice.  Tags are automatically realigned after promotion,
     demotion, and TODO state changes (see *note TODO Basics::).

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-set-tags-command’)
     When point is in a headline, this does the same as ‘C-c C-q’.

   Org supports tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By default
this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags currently used
in the buffer(1).  You may also globally specify a hard list of tags
with the variable ‘org-tag-alist’.  Finally you can set the default tags
for a given file using the ‘TAGS’ keyword, like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable ‘org-tag-alist’, but would like to use a dynamic tag list in a
specific file, add an empty ‘TAGS’ keyword to that file:

     #+TAGS:

   If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in
every file, in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by ‘TAGS’
keyword, then you may specify a list of tags with the variable
‘org-tag-persistent-alist’.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a ‘STARTUP’ keyword to that file:

     #+STARTUP: noptag

   By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion
facilities for entering tags.  However, it also implements another,
quicker, tag selection method called _fast tag selection_.  This allows
you to select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this
to work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
‘org-tag-alist’ in your Emacs init file.  For example, you may find the
need to tag many items in different files with ‘@home’.  In this case
you can set something like:

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

   If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the ‘TAGS’ keyword as:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

   The tags interface shows the available tags in a splash window.  If
you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert ‘\n’ into the
tag list

     #+TAGS: @work(w) @home(h) @tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l) pc(p)

or write them in two lines:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)
     #+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)

   You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

     #+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)

you indicate that at most one of ‘@work’, ‘@home’, and ‘@tennisclub’
should be selected.  Multiple such groups are allowed.

   Do not forget to press ‘C-c C-c’ with point in one of these lines to
activate any changes.

   To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable
‘org-tags-alist’, you must use the dummy tags ‘:startgroup’ and
‘:endgroup’ instead of the braces.  Similarly, you can use ‘:newline’ to
indicate a line break.  The previous example would be set globally by
the following configuration:

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                           ("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h)
                           ("@tennisclub" . ?t)
                           (:endgroup . nil)
                           ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))

   If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing ‘C-c C-c’
automatically presents you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags
with corresponding keys(2).

   Pressing keys assigned to tags adds or removes them from the list of
tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of mutually
exclusive tags turns off any other tag from that group.

   In this interface, you can also use the following special keys:

‘<TAB>’
     Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the
     predefined list.  You can complete on all tags present in the
     buffer.  You can also add several tags: just separate them with a
     comma.

‘<SPC>’
     Clear all tags for this line.

‘<RET>’
     Accept the modified set.

‘C-g’
     Abort without installing changes.

‘q’
     If ‘q’ is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like ‘C-g’.

‘!’
     Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
     exception) assign several tags from such a group.

‘C-c’
     Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).  If you are
     using expert mode, the first ‘C-c’ displays the selection window.

   This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.
With the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set ‘@home’,
‘laptop’ and ‘pc’ tags with just the following keys: ‘C-c C-c <SPC> h l
p <RET>’.  Switching from ‘@home’ to ‘@work’ would be done with ‘C-c C-c
w <RET>’ or alternatively with ‘C-c C-c C-c w’.  Adding the
non-predefined tag ‘sarah’ could be done with ‘C-c C-c <TAB> s a r a h
<RET>’.

   If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
‘org-fast-tag-selection-single-key’.  Then you no longer have to press
‘<RET>’ to exit fast tag selection—it exits after the first change.  If
you then occasionally need more keys, press ‘C-c’ to turn off auto-exit
for the current tag selection process (in effect: start selection with
‘C-c C-c C-c’ instead of ‘C-c C-c’).  If you set the variable to the
value ‘expert’, the special window is not even shown for single-key tag
selection, it comes up only when you press an extra ‘C-c’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To extend this default list to all tags used in all agenda files
(see *note Agenda Views::), customize the variable
‘org-complete-tags-always-offer-all-agenda-tags’.

   (2) Keys are automatically assigned to tags that have no configured
keys.


File: org,  Node: Tag Hierarchy,  Next: Tag Searches,  Prev: Setting Tags,  Up: Tags

6.3 Tag Hierarchy
=================

Tags can be defined in hierarchies.  A tag can be defined as a _group
tag_ for a set of other tags.  The group tag can be seen as the “broader
term” for its set of tags.  Defining multiple group tags and nesting
them creates a tag hierarchy.

   One use-case is to create a taxonomy of terms (tags) that can be used
to classify nodes in a document or set of documents.

   When you search for a group tag, it return matches for all members in
the group and its subgroups.  In an agenda view, filtering by a group
tag displays or hide headlines tagged with at least one of the members
of the group or any of its subgroups.  This makes tag searches and
filters even more flexible.

   You can set group tags by using brackets and inserting a colon
between the group tag and its related tags—beware that all whitespaces
are mandatory so that Org can parse this line correctly:

     #+TAGS: [ GTD : Control Persp ]

   In this example, ‘GTD’ is the group tag and it is related to two
other tags: ‘Control’, ‘Persp’.  Defining ‘Control’ and ‘Persp’ as group
tags creates a hierarchy of tags:

     #+TAGS: [ Control : Context Task ]
     #+TAGS: [ Persp : Vision Goal AOF Project ]

   That can conceptually be seen as a hierarchy of tags:

   • ‘GTD’
        • ‘Persp’
             • ‘Vision’
             • ‘Goal’
             • ‘AOF’
             • ‘Project’
        • ‘Control’
             • ‘Context’
             • ‘Task’

   You can use the ‘:startgrouptag’, ‘:grouptags’ and ‘:endgrouptag’
keyword directly when setting ‘org-tag-alist’ directly:

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag)
                           ("GTD")
                           (:grouptags)
                           ("Control")
                           ("Persp")
                           (:endgrouptag)
                           (:startgrouptag)
                           ("Control")
                           (:grouptags)
                           ("Context")
                           ("Task")
                           (:endgrouptag)))

   The tags in a group can be mutually exclusive if using the same group
syntax as is used for grouping mutually exclusive tags together; using
curly brackets.

     #+TAGS: { Context : @Home @Work @Call }

   When setting ‘org-tag-alist’ you can use ‘:startgroup’ and
‘:endgroup’ instead of ‘:startgrouptag’ and ‘:endgrouptag’ to make the
tags mutually exclusive.

   Furthermore, the members of a group tag can also be regular
expressions, creating the possibility of a more dynamic and rule-based
tag structure.  The regular expressions in the group must be specified
within curly brackets.  Here is an expanded example:

     #+TAGS: [ Vision : {V@.+} ]
     #+TAGS: [ Goal : {G@.+} ]
     #+TAGS: [ AOF : {AOF@.+} ]
     #+TAGS: [ Project : {P@.+} ]

   Searching for the tag ‘Project’ now lists all tags also including
regular expression matches for ‘P@.+’, and similarly for tag searches on
‘Vision’, ‘Goal’ and ‘AOF’.  For example, this would work well for a
project tagged with a common project-identifier, e.g., ‘P@2014_OrgTags’.

   If you want to ignore group tags temporarily, toggle group tags
support with ‘org-toggle-tags-groups’, bound to ‘C-c C-x q’.  If you
want to disable tag groups completely, set ‘org-group-tags’ to ‘nil’.


File: org,  Node: Tag Searches,  Prev: Tag Hierarchy,  Up: Tags

6.4 Tag Searches
================

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

‘C-c / m’ or ‘C-c \’ (‘org-match-sparse-tree’)
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.
     With a ‘C-u’ prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
     line.

‘M-x org-agenda m’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  See
     *note Matching tags and properties::.

‘M-x org-agenda M’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see the option
     ‘org-tags-match-list-sublevels’).

   These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like ‘+boss+urgent-project1’, to find entries with tags
‘boss’ and ‘urgent’, but not ‘project1’, or ‘Kathy|Sally’ to find
entries which are tagged, like ‘Kathy’ or ‘Sally’.  The full syntax of
the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO
keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a complete description with
many examples, see *note Matching tags and properties::.

7 Properties and Columns
************************

A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry.  Properties can
be set so they are associated with a single entry, with every entry in a
tree, or with every entry in an Org file.

   There are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First,
properties are like tags, but with a value.  Imagine maintaining a file
where you document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.
Instead of using tags like ‘release_1’, ‘release_2’, you can use a
property, say ‘Release’, that in different subtrees has different
values, such as ‘1.0’ or ‘2.0’.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  Imagine
keeping track of your music CDs, where properties could be things such
as the album, artist, date of release, number of tracks, and so on.

   Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view (see
*note Column View::).

* Menu:

* Property Syntax::              How properties are spelled out.
* Special Properties::           Access to other Org mode features.
* Property Searches::            Matching property values.
* Property Inheritance::         Passing values down a tree.
* Column View::                  Tabular viewing and editing.


File: org,  Node: Property Syntax,  Next: Special Properties,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.1 Property Syntax
===================

Properties are key–value pairs.  When they are associated with a single
entry or with a tree they need to be inserted into a special drawer (see
*note Drawers::) with the name ‘PROPERTIES’, which has to be located
right below a headline, and its planning line (see *note Deadlines and
Scheduling::) when applicable.  Each property is specified on a single
line, with the key—surrounded by colons—first, and the value after it.
Keys are case-insensitive.  Here is an example:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glenn Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   Depending on the value of ‘org-use-property-inheritance’, a property
set this way is associated either with a single entry, or with the
sub-tree defined by the entry, see *note Property Inheritance::.

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property ‘Xyz’ by
setting a property ‘Xyz_ALL’.  This special property is _inherited_, so
if you set it in a level 1 entry, it applies to the entire tree.  When
allowed values are defined, setting the corresponding property becomes
easier and is less prone to typing errors.  For the example with the CD
collection, we can pre-define publishers and the number of disks in a
box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like:

     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   If you want to add to the value of an existing property, append a ‘+’
to the property name.  The following results in the property ‘var’
having the value ‘foo=1 bar=2’.

     #+PROPERTY: var  foo=1
     #+PROPERTY: var+ bar=2

   It is also possible to add to the values of inherited properties.
The following results in the ‘Genres’ property having the value ‘Classic
Baroque’ under the ‘Goldberg Variations’ subtree.

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Genres: Classic
         :END:
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glenn Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :Genres+:   Baroque
         :END:

   Note that a property can only have one entry per drawer.

   Property values set with the global variable ‘org-global-properties’
can be inherited by all entries in all Org files.

   The following commands help to work with properties:

‘M-<TAB>’ (‘pcomplete’)
     After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All keys
     used in the current file are offered as possible completions.

‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’)
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
     necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

‘C-u M-x org-insert-drawer’
     Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer is
     inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
     information like deadlines.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-property-action’)
     With point in a property drawer, this executes property commands.

‘C-c C-c s’ (‘org-set-property’)
     Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the
     value can be inserted using completion.

‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-values’)
‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’)
     Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.

‘C-c C-c d’ (‘org-delete-property’)
     Remove a property from the current entry.

‘C-c C-c D’ (‘org-delete-property-globally’)
     Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.

‘C-c C-c c’ (‘org-compute-property-at-point’)
     Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from
     the nearest column format definition.

7.2 Special Properties
======================

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode
features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in
the previous chapters.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states in a column view (see *note Column View::), or to use them
in queries.  The following property names are special and should not be
used as keys in the properties drawer:

‘ALLTAGS’        All tags, including inherited ones.
‘BLOCKED’        ‘t’ if task is currently blocked by children or siblings.
‘CATEGORY’       The category of an entry.
‘CLOCKSUM’       The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.  ‘org-clock-sum’
                 must be run first to compute the values in the current buffer.
‘CLOCKSUM_T’     The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree for today.
                 ‘org-clock-sum-today’ must be run first to compute the
                 values in the current buffer.
‘CLOSED’         When was this entry closed?
‘DEADLINE’       The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.
‘FILE’           The filename the entry is located in.
‘ITEM’           The headline of the entry.
‘PRIORITY’       The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
‘SCHEDULED’      The scheduling timestamp, without the angular brackets.
‘TAGS’           The tags defined directly in the headline.
‘TIMESTAMP’      The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.
‘TIMESTAMP_IA’   The first inactive timestamp in the entry.
‘TODO’           The TODO keyword of the entry.


File: org,  Node: Property Searches,  Next: Property Inheritance,  Prev: Special Properties,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.3 Property Searches
=====================

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (see *note
Tag Searches::).

‘C-c / m’ or ‘C-c \’ (‘org-match-sparse-tree’)
     Create a sparse tree with all matching entries.  With a ‘C-u’
     prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.

‘M-x org-agenda m’, ‘org-tags-view’
     Create a global list of tag/property matches from all agenda files.

‘M-x org-agenda M’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see the
     option ‘org-tags-match-list-sublevels’).

   The syntax for the search string is described in *note Matching tags
and properties::.

   There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

‘C-c / p’
     Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
     prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A sparse
     tree is created with all entries that define this property with the
     given value.  If you enclose the value in curly braces, it is
     interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the
     property values.


File: org,  Node: Property Inheritance,  Next: Column View,  Prev: Property Searches,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.4 Property Inheritance
========================

The outline structure of Org documents lends itself to an inheritance
model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain property, the
children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not turn this on by
default, because it can slow down property searches significantly and is
often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance useful, you can turn
it on by setting the variable ‘org-use-property-inheritance’.  It may be
set to ‘t’ to make all properties inherited from the parent, to a list
of properties that should be inherited, or to a regular expression that
matches inherited properties.  If a property has the value ‘nil’, this
is interpreted as an explicit un-define of the property, so that
inheritance search stops at this value and returns ‘nil’.

   Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

‘COLUMNS’
     The ‘COLUMNS’ property defines the format of column view (see *note
     Column View::).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where
     a ‘COLUMNS’ property is defined is used as the starting point for a
     column view table, independently of the location in the subtree
     from where columns view is turned on.

‘CATEGORY’
     For agenda view, a category set through a ‘CATEGORY’ property
     applies to the entire subtree.

‘ARCHIVE’
     For archiving, the ‘ARCHIVE’ property may define the archive
     location for the entire subtree (see *note Moving subtrees::).

‘LOGGING’
     The ‘LOGGING’ property may define logging settings for an entry or
     a subtree (see *note Tracking TODO state changes::).


File: org,  Node: Column View,  Prev: Property Inheritance,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.5 Column View
===============

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is _column
view_.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.  Org
mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.  For
example, you get a compact table by switching to “contents”
view—‘S-<TAB>’ ‘S-<TAB>’, or simply ‘c’ while column view is active—but
you can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline.  Or,
you can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and
in this way get a table only for the selected items.  Column view also
works in agenda buffers (see *note Agenda Views::) where queries have
collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

* Menu:

* Defining columns::             The COLUMNS format property.
* Using column view::            How to create and use column view.

File: org,  Node: Defining columns,  Next: Using column view,  Up: Column View

7.5.1 Defining columns
----------------------

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Menu:

* Scope of column definitions::  Where defined, where valid?
* Column attributes::            Appearance and content of a column.


File: org,  Node: Scope of column definitions,  Next: Column attributes,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.1 Scope of column definitions
...................................

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like:

     #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

   To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
‘COLUMNS’ property to the top node of that tree, for example:

     ** Top node for columns view
        :PROPERTIES:
        :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
        :END:

   If a ‘COLUMNS’ property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.


File: org,  Node: Column attributes,  Prev: Scope of column definitions,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.2 Column attributes
.........................

A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

     %[WIDTH]PROPERTY[(TITLE)][{SUMMARY-TYPE}]

Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

WIDTH
     An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.  If
     omitted, the width is determined automatically.

PROPERTY
     The property that should be edited in this column.  Special
     properties representing meta data are allowed here as well (see
     *note Special Properties::).

TITLE
     The header text for the column.  If omitted, the property name is
     used.

SUMMARY-TYPE
     The summary type.  If specified, the column values for parent nodes
     are computed from the children(1).

     Supported summary types are:

     ‘+’        Sum numbers in this column.
     ‘+;%.1f’   Like ‘+’, but format result with ‘%.1f’.
     ‘$’        Currency, short for ‘+;%.2f’.
     ‘min’      Smallest number in column.
     ‘max’      Largest number.
     ‘mean’     Arithmetic mean of numbers.
     ‘X’        Checkbox status, ‘[X]’ if all children are ‘[X]’.
     ‘X/’       Checkbox status, ‘[n/m]’.
     ‘X%’       Checkbox status, ‘[n%]’.
     ‘:’        Sum times, HH:MM, plain numbers are hours.
     ‘:min’     Smallest time value in column.
     ‘:max’     Largest time value.
     ‘:mean’    Arithmetic mean of time values.
     ‘@min’     Minimum age(2) (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
     ‘@max’     Maximum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
     ‘@mean’    Arithmetic mean of ages (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
     ‘est+’     Add low-high estimates.

     You can also define custom summary types by setting
     ‘org-columns-summary-types’.

   The ‘est+’ summary type requires further explanation.  It is used for
combining estimates, expressed as low-high ranges.  For example, instead
of estimating a particular task will take 5 days, you might estimate it
as 5–6 days if you’re fairly confident you know how much work is
required, or 1–10 days if you do not really know what needs to be done.
Both ranges average at 5.5 days, but the first represents a more
predictable delivery.

   When combining a set of such estimates, simply adding the lows and
highs produces an unrealistically wide result.  Instead, ‘est+’ adds the
statistical mean and variance of the subtasks, generating a final
estimate from the sum.  For example, suppose you had ten tasks, each of
which was estimated at 0.5 to 2 days of work.  Straight addition
produces an estimate of 5 to 20 days, representing what to expect if
everything goes either extremely well or extremely poorly.  In contrast,
‘est+’ estimates the full job more realistically, at 10–15 days.

   Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with
allowed values(3).

     :COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status \
                        %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM %CLOCKSUM_T
     :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
     :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
     :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"

The first column, ‘%25ITEM’, means the first 25 characters of the item
itself, i.e., of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the ‘ITEM’ specifier.  The other specifiers
create columns ‘Owner’ with a list of names as allowed values, for
‘Status’ with four different possible values, and for a checkbox field
‘Approved’.  When no width is given after the ‘%’ character, the column
is exactly as wide as it needs to be in order to fully display all
values.  The ‘Approved’ column does have a modified title (‘Approved?’,
with a question mark).  Summaries are created for the ‘Time_Estimate’
column by adding time duration expressions like HH:MM, and for the
‘Approved’ column, by providing an ‘[X]’ status if all children have
been checked.  The ‘CLOCKSUM’ and ‘CLOCKSUM_T’ columns are special, they
lists the sums of CLOCK intervals in the subtree, either for all clocks
or just for today.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If more than one summary type applies to the same property, the
parent values are computed according to the first of them.

   (2) An age can be defined as a duration, using units defined in
‘org-duration-units’, e.g., ‘3d 1h’.  If any value in the column is as
such, the summary is also expressed as a duration.

   (3) Please note that the ‘COLUMNS’ definition must be on a single
line; it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.

7.5.2 Using column view
-----------------------

Turning column view on or off
.............................

‘C-c C-x C-c’ (‘org-columns’)
     Turn on column view.  If point is before the first headline in the
     file, column view is turned on for the entire file, using the
     ‘#+COLUMNS’ definition.  If point is somewhere inside the outline,
     this command searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a ‘COLUMNS’
     property that defines a format.  When one is found, the column view
     table is established for the tree starting at the entry that
     contains the ‘COLUMNS’ property.  If no such property is found, the
     format is taken from the ‘#+COLUMNS’ line or from the variable
     ‘org-columns-default-format’, and column view is established for
     the current entry and its subtree.

‘r’ or ‘g’ (‘org-columns-redo’)
     Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the
     buffer.

‘q’ (‘org-columns-quit’)
     Exit column view.

Editing values
..............

‘<LEFT>’, ‘<RIGHT>’, ‘<UP>’, ‘<DOWN>’
     Move through the column view from field to field.

‘1..9,0’
     Directly select the Nth allowed value, ‘0’ selects the 10th value.

‘n’ or ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-columns-next-allowed-value’)
‘p’ or ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-columns-previous-allowed-value’)
     Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this,
     you have to have specified allowed values for a property.

‘e’ (‘org-columns-edit-value’)
     Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this
     invokes the same interface that you normally use to change that
     property.  For example, the tag completion or fast selection
     interface pops up when editing a ‘TAGS’ property.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-columns-set-tags-or-toggle’)
     When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.

‘v’ (‘org-columns-show-value’)
     View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width
     of the column is smaller than that of the value.

‘a’ (‘org-columns-edit-allowed’)
     Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is
     found in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If no
     list is found, the new value is stored in the first entry that is
     part of the current column view.

Modifying column view on-the-fly
................................

‘<’ (‘org-columns-narrow’)
‘>’ (‘org-columns-widen’)
     Make the column narrower/wider by one character.

‘S-M-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-columns-new’)
     Insert a new column, to the left of the current column.

‘S-M-<LEFT>’ (‘org-columns-delete’)
     Delete the current column.


File: org,  Node: Capturing column view,  Prev: Using column view,  Up: Column View

7.5.3 Capturing column view
---------------------------

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see *note Dynamic Blocks::).  The frame of
this block looks like this:

     * The column view
     #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

     #+END:

   This dynamic block has the following parameters:

‘:id’
     This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature
     that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture
     block might be at a different location in the file.  To identify
     the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values:

     ‘local’
          Use the tree in which the capture block is located.

     ‘global’
          Make a global view, including all headings in the file.

     ‘file:FILENAME’
          Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file.

     ‘LABEL’
          Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with
          the value LABEL.  You can use ‘M-x org-id-copy’ to create a
          globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the
          kill-ring.

‘:hlines’
     When ‘t’, insert an hline after every line.  When a number N,
     insert an hline before each headline with level ‘<= N’.

‘:vlines’
     When non-‘nil’, force column groups to get vertical lines.

‘:maxlevel’
     When set to a number, do not capture entries below this level.

‘:skip-empty-rows’
     When non-‘nil’, skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of the
     column view is ‘ITEM’.

‘:indent’
     When non-‘nil’, indent each ‘ITEM’ field according to its level.

‘:format’
     Specify a column attribute (see *note Column attributes::) for the
     dynamic block.

   The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

‘C-c C-x i’ (‘org-insert-columns-dblock’)
     Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  Prompt for the
     scope or ID of the view.

‘C-c C-c’ ‘C-c C-x C-u’ (‘org-dblock-update’)
     Update dynamic block at point.  point needs to be in the ‘#+BEGIN’
     line of the dynamic block.

‘C-u C-c C-x C-u’ (‘org-update-all-dblocks’)
     Update all dynamic blocks (see *note Dynamic Blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks, column-capturing
     blocks or other dynamic blocks in a buffer.

   You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add
plotting instructions in front of the table—these survive an update of
the block.  If there is a ‘TBLFM’ keyword after the table, the table is
recalculated automatically after an update.

   An alternative way to capture and process property values into a
table is provided by Eric Schulte’s ‘org-collector.el’, which is a
contributed package(1).  It provides a general API to collect properties
from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp expressions to
process these values before inserting them into a table or a dynamic
block.

8 Dates and Times
*****************

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a _timestamp_ in Org mode.  This may be a little
confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something
was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term is used in
a much wider sense.

File: org,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Creating Timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.1 Timestamps, Deadlines and Scheduling
========================================

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a
range of times) in a special format, either ‘<2003-09-16 Tue>’ or
‘<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>’ or ‘<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>’(1).  A
timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree
entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the
agenda (see *note Weekly/daily agenda::).  We distinguish:

Plain timestamp; Event; Appointment
     A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     In the agenda display, the headline of an entry associated with a
     plain timestamp is shown exactly on that date.

          * Meet Peter at the movies
            <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change
            <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

Timestamp with repeater interval
     A timestamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years
     (y).  The following shows up in the agenda every Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school
            <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

Diary-style sexp entries
     For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
     special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
     package(2).  For example, with optional time:

          * 22:00-23:00 The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

Time/Date range
     Two timestamps connected by ‘--’ denote a range.  The headline is
     shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any dates that
     are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an example:

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>

Inactive timestamp
     Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that they
     do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time
            [2006-11-01 Wed]

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The Org date format is inspired by the standard ISO 8601
date/time format.  To use an alternative format, see *note Custom time
format::.  The day name is optional when you type the date yourself.
However, any date inserted or modified by Org adds that day name, for
reading convenience.

   (2) When working with the standard diary sexp functions, you need to
be very careful with the order of the arguments.  That order depends
evilly on the variable ‘calendar-date-style’.  For example, to specify a
date December 12, 2005, the call might look like ‘(diary-date 12 1
2005)’ or ‘(diary-date 1 12 2005)’ or ‘(diary-date 2005 12 1)’,
depending on the settings.  This has been the source of much confusion.
Org mode users can resort to special versions of these functions like
‘org-date’ or ‘org-anniversary’.  These work just like the corresponding
‘diary-’ functions, but with stable ISO order of arguments (year, month,
day) wherever applicable, independent of the value of
‘calendar-date-style’.

8.2 Creating Timestamps
=======================

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

‘C-c .’ (‘org-time-stamp’)
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When point
     is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used to
     modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.  When this
     command is used twice in succession, a time range is inserted.

     When called with a prefix argument, use the alternative format
     which contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded to
     multiples of 5 minutes.  See the option
     ‘org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes’.

     With two prefix arguments, insert an active timestamp with the
     current time without prompting.

‘C-c !’ (‘org-time-stamp-inactive’)
     Like ‘C-c .’, but insert an inactive timestamp that does not cause
     an agenda entry.

‘C-c C-c’
     Normalize timestamp, insert or fix day name if missing or wrong.

‘C-c <’ (‘org-date-from-calendar’)
     Insert a timestamp corresponding to point date in the calendar.

‘C-c >’ (‘org-goto-calendar’)
     Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
     timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
     instead.

‘C-c C-o’ (‘org-open-at-point’)
     Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
     point (see *note Weekly/daily agenda::).

‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-timestamp-down-day’)
‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-timestamp-up-day’)
     Change date at point by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
     shift-selection and related modes (see *note Conflicts::).

‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-timestamp-up’)
‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-timestamp-down’)
     On the beginning or enclosing bracket of a timestamp, change its
     type.  Within a timestamp, change the item under point.  Point can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp
     contains a time range like ‘15:30-16:30’, modifying the first time
     also shifts the second, shifting the time block with constant
     length.  To change the length, modify the second time.  Note that
     if point is in a headline and not at a timestamp, these same keys
     modify the priority of an item (see *note Priorities::).  The key
     bindings also conflict with shift-selection and related modes (see
     *note Conflicts::).

‘C-c C-y’ (‘org-evaluate-time-range’)
     Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and
     end.  With a prefix argument, insert result after the time range
     (in a table: into the following column).

* Custom time format::           Making dates look different.


File: org,  Node: The date/time prompt,  Next: Custom time format,  Up: Creating Timestamps

8.2.1 The date/time prompt
--------------------------

When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it in fact accepts date/time information in a variety of
formats.  Generally, the information should start at the beginning of
the string.  Org mode finds whatever information is in there and derives
anything you have not specified from the _default date and time_.  The
default is usually the current date and time, but when modifying an
existing timestamp, or when entering the second stamp of a range, it is
taken from the stamp in the buffer.  When filling in information, Org
mode assumes that most of the time you want to enter a date in the
future: if you omit the month/year and the given day/month is _before_
today, it assumes that you mean a future date(1).  If the date has been
automatically shifted into the future, the time prompt shows this with
‘(=>F)’.

   For example, let’s assume that today is *June 13, 2006*.  Here is how
various inputs are interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode are in
*bold*.

‘3-2-5’          ⇒ 2003-02-05
‘2/5/3’          ⇒ 2003-02-05
‘14’             ⇒ *2006*-*06*-14
‘12’             ⇒ *2006*-*07*-12
‘2/5’            ⇒ *2007*-02-05
‘Fri’            ⇒ nearest Friday (default date or later)
‘sep 15’         ⇒ *2006*-09-15
‘feb 15’         ⇒ *2007*-02-15
‘sep 12 9’       ⇒ 2009-09-12
‘12:45’          ⇒ *2006*-*06*-*13* 12:45
‘22 sept 0:34’   ⇒ *2006*-09-22 0:34
‘w4’             ⇒ ISO week for of the current year *2006*
‘2012 w4 fri’    ⇒ Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012
‘2012-w04-5’     ⇒ Same as above

   Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the _first_
thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter—‘d’, ‘w’,
‘m’ or ‘y’—to indicate change in days, weeks, months, or years.  With a
single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a
double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of
a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date is the
Nth such day, e.g.:

‘+0’      ⇒ today
‘.’       ⇒ today
‘+4d’     ⇒ four days from today
‘+4’      ⇒ same as +4d
‘+2w’     ⇒ two weeks from today
‘++5’     ⇒ five days from default date
‘+2tue’   ⇒ second Tuesday from now

   The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use un-abbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables ‘parse-time-months’ and ‘parse-time-weekdays’.

   Not all dates can be represented in a given Emacs implementation.  By
default Org mode forces dates into the compatibility range 1970–2037
which works on all Emacs implementations.  If you want to use dates
outside of this range, read the docstring of the variable
‘org-read-date-force-compatible-dates’.

   You can specify a time range by giving start and end times or by
giving a start time and a duration (in HH:MM format).  Use one or two
dash(es) as the separator in the former case and use ‘+’ as the
separator in the latter case, e.g.:

‘11am-1:15pm’    ⇒ 11:00-13:15
‘11am--1:15pm’   ⇒ same as above
‘11am+2:15’      ⇒ same as above

   Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up(2).  When
you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar,
or by pressing ‘<RET>’, the date selected in the calendar is combined
with the information entered at the prompt.  You can control the
calendar fully from the minibuffer:

‘<RET>’            Choose date at point in calendar.
‘mouse-1’          Select date by clicking on it.
‘S-<RIGHT>’        One day forward.
‘S-<LEFT>’         One day backward.
‘S-<DOWN>’         One week forward.
‘S-<UP>’           One week backward.
‘M-S-<RIGHT>’      One month forward.
‘M-S-<LEFT>’       One month backward.
‘>’                Scroll calendar forward by one month.
‘<’                Scroll calendar backward by one month.
‘M-v’              Scroll calendar forward by 3 months.
‘C-v’              Scroll calendar backward by 3 months.

   The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure
you they will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty
much any other way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you
understand what is going on, the current interpretation of your input is
displayed live in the minibuffer(3).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable ‘org-read-date-prefer-future’.  You may set that
variable to the symbol ‘time’ to even make a time before now shift the
date to tomorrow.

   (2) If you do not need/want the calendar, configure the variable
‘org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt’.

   (3) If you find this distracting, turn off the display with
‘org-read-date-display-live’.


File: org,  Node: Custom time format,  Prev: The date/time prompt,  Up: Creating Timestamps

8.2.2 Custom time format
------------------------

Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the variables ‘org-display-custom-times’ and
‘org-time-stamp-custom-formats’.

‘C-c C-x C-t’ (‘org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays’)
     Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.

   Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom
date/time format does not _replace_ the default format.  Instead, it is
put _over_ the default format using text properties.  This has the
following consequences:

   • You cannot place point onto a timestamp anymore, only before or
     after.

   • The ‘S-<UP>’ and ‘S-<DOWN>’ keys can no longer be used to adjust
     each component of a timestamp.  If point is at the beginning of the
     stamp, ‘S-<UP>’ and ‘S-<DOWN>’ change the stamp by one day, just
     like ‘S-<LEFT>’ ‘S-<RIGHT>’.  At the end of the stamp, change the
     time by one minute.

   • If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
     these are not overlaid, but remain in the buffer as they were.

   • When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it only
     disappears from the buffer after _all_ (invisible) characters
     belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

   • If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you
     are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
     the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.

8.3 Deadlines and Scheduling
============================

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning.
Both the timestamp and the keyword have to be positioned immediately
after the task they refer to.

‘DEADLINE’
     Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not necessarily)
     is supposed to be finished on that date.

     On the deadline date, the task is listed in the agenda.  In
     addition, the agenda for _today_ carries a warning about the
     approaching or missed deadline, starting
     ‘org-deadline-warning-days’ before the due date, and continuing
     until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]

     You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
     deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
     warning period of 5 days ‘DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>’.  This
     warning is deactivated if the task gets scheduled and you set
     ‘org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled’ to ‘t’.

‘SCHEDULED’
     Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the
     given date.

     The headline is listed under the given date(1).  In addition, a
     reminder that the scheduled date has passed is present in the
     compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e., the
     task is automatically forwarded until completed.

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

     If you want to _delay_ the display of this task in the agenda, use
     ‘SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat -2d>’: the task is still scheduled on
     the 25th but will appear two days later.  In case the task contains
     a repeater, the delay is considered to affect all occurrences; if
     you want the delay to only affect the first scheduled occurrence of
     the task, use ‘--2d’ instead.  See ‘org-scheduled-delay-days’ and
     ‘org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline’ for details on how to
     control this globally or per agenda.

          Important: Scheduling an item in Org mode should _not_ be
          understood in the same way that we understand _scheduling a
          meeting_.  Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple
          appointment, you should mark this entry with a simple plain
          timestamp, to get this item shown on the date where it
          applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding by Org users.
          In Org mode, _scheduling_ means setting a date when you want
          to start working on an action item.

   You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode issues early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the _nearest instance_ of the
repeater.  However, the use of diary S-exp entries like

     <%%(diary-float t 42)>

in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode does not
know enough about the internals of each S-exp function to issue early
and late warnings.  However, it shows the item on each day where the
S-exp entry matches.

* Inserting deadline/schedule::  Planning items.
* Repeated tasks::               Items that show up again and again.

File: org,  Node: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Next: Repeated tasks,  Up: Deadlines and Scheduling

8.3.1 Inserting deadlines or schedules
--------------------------------------

The following commands allow you to quickly insert a deadline or to
schedule an item:(1)

‘C-c C-d’ (‘org-deadline’)
     Insert ‘DEADLINE’ keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion
     happens in the line directly following the headline.  Remove any
     ‘CLOSED’ timestamp .  When called with a prefix argument, also
     remove any existing deadline from the entry.  Depending on the
     variable ‘org-log-redeadline’, take a note when changing an
     existing deadline(2).

‘C-c C-s’ (‘org-schedule’)
     Insert ‘SCHEDULED’ keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion
     happens in the line directly following the headline.  Remove any
     ‘CLOSED’ timestamp.  When called with a prefix argument, also
     remove the scheduling date from the entry.  Depending on the
     variable ‘org-log-reschedule’, take a note when changing an
     existing scheduling time(3).

‘C-c C-x C-k’ (‘org-mark-entry-for-agenda-action’)
     Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked
     the entry like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to
     find an appropriate date.  With point on the selected date, press
     ‘k s’ or ‘k d’ to schedule the marked item.

‘C-c / d’ (‘org-check-deadlines’)
     Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due,
     or which will become due within ‘org-deadline-warning-days’.  With
     ‘C-u’ prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
     prefix, check that many days.  For example, ‘C-1 C-c / d’ shows all
     deadlines due tomorrow.

‘C-c / b’ (‘org-check-before-date’)
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.

‘C-c / a’ (‘org-check-after-date’)
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.

   Note that ‘org-schedule’ and ‘org-deadline’ supports setting the date
by indicating a relative time e.g., ‘+1d’ sets the date to the next day
after today, and ‘--1w’ sets the date to the previous week before any
current timestamp.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The ‘SCHEDULED’ and ‘DEADLINE’ dates are inserted on the line
right below the headline.  Do not put any text between this line and the
headline.

   (2) Note the corresponding ‘STARTUP’ options ‘logredeadline’,
‘lognoteredeadline’, and ‘nologredeadline’.

   (3) Note the corresponding ‘STARTUP’ options ‘logreschedule’,
‘lognotereschedule’, and ‘nologreschedule’.


File: org,  Node: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Up: Deadlines and Scheduling

8.3.2 Repeated tasks
--------------------

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a ‘DEADLINE’,
‘SCHEDULED’, or plain timestamp.  In the following example:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>

the ‘+1m’ is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on ‘<2005-10-01>’ and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.  You can use yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and
hourly repeat cookies by using the ‘y/w/m/d/h’ letters.  If you need
both a repeater and a special warning period in a deadline entry, the
repeater should come first and the warning period last: ‘DEADLINE:
<2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>’.

   Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
DONE once you have done so.  When you mark a ‘DEADLINE’ or a ‘SCHEDULED’
with the TODO keyword ‘DONE’, it no longer produces entries in the
agenda.  The problem with this is, however, is that then also the _next_
instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode deals with
this in the following way: when you try to mark such an entry DONE,
using ‘C-c C-t’, it shifts the base date of the repeating timestamp by
the repeater interval, and immediately sets the entry state back to
TODO(1). In the example above, setting the state to DONE would actually
switch the date like this:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>

   To mark a task with a repeater as DONE, use ‘C-- 1 C-c C-t’, i.e.,
‘org-todo’ with a numeric prefix argument of ‘-1’.

   A timestamp(2) is added under the deadline, to keep a record that you
actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

   As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry is no longer
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances
will be visible.

   With the ‘+1m’ cookie, the date shift is always exactly one month.
So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this entry
DONE still keeps it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the task, this
may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you forgot to
call your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call him 3 times
in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks like
changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time _after_ the
last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has special repeaters
‘++’ and ‘.+’.  For example:

     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
        Marking this DONE shifts the date by at least one week, but also
        by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into the future.
        However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called and marked it
        done on Saturday.

     ** TODO Empty kitchen trash
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-08 Fri 20:00 ++1d>
        Marking this DONE shifts the date by at least one day, and also
        by as many days as it takes to get the timestamp into the future.
        Since there is a time in the timestamp, the next deadline in the
        future will be on today's date if you complete the task before
        20:00.

     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after today.

   You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task.  If the repeater is set for the scheduling information only, you
probably want the repeater to be ignored after the deadline.  If so, set
the variable ‘org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown’ to
‘repeated-after-deadline’.  However, any scheduling information without
a repeater is no longer relevant once the task is done, and thus,
removed upon repeating the task.  If you want both scheduling and
deadline information to repeat after the same interval, set the same
repeater for both timestamps.

   An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies of
a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command ‘C-c C-x
c’ was created for this purpose; it is described in *note Structure
Editing::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In fact, the target state is taken from, in this sequence, the
‘REPEAT_TO_STATE’ property, the variable ‘org-todo-repeat-to-state’ if
it is a string, the previous TODO state if ‘org-todo-repeat-to-state’ is
‘t’, or the first state of the TODO state sequence.

   (2) You can change this using the option ‘org-log-repeat’, or the
‘STARTUP’ options ‘logrepeat’, ‘lognoterepeat’, and ‘nologrepeat’.  With
‘lognoterepeat’, you will also be prompted for a note.


File: org,  Node: Clocking Work Time,  Next: Effort Estimates,  Prev: Deadlines and Scheduling,  Up: Dates and Times

8.4 Clocking Work Time
======================

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree(1) of a project.  And
it remembers a history or tasks recently clocked, to that you can jump
quickly between a number of tasks absorbing your time.

   To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use:

     (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
     (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)

   When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock(2) is retrieved (see *note Resolving idle time (1)::) and you are
prompted about what to do with it.

* Menu:

* Clocking commands::            Starting and stopping a clock.
* The clock table::              Detailed reports.
* Resolving idle time::          Resolving time when you’ve been idle.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Clocking only works if all headings are indented with less than
30 stars.  This is a hard-coded limitation of ‘lmax’ in ‘org-clock-sum’.

   (2) To resume the clock under the assumption that you have worked on
this task while outside Emacs, use ‘(setq org-clock-persist t)’.


File: org,  Node: Clocking commands,  Next: The clock table,  Up: Clocking Work Time

8.4.1 Clocking commands
-----------------------

‘C-c C-x C-i’ (‘org-clock-in’)
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     CLOCK keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first
     clocking of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines are wrapped into a
     ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer (see also the variable ‘org-clock-into-drawer’).
     You can also overrule the setting of this variable for a subtree by
     setting a ‘CLOCK_INTO_DRAWER’ or ‘LOG_INTO_DRAWER’ property.  When
     called with a ‘C-u’ prefix argument, select the task from a list of
     recently clocked tasks.  With two ‘C-u C-u’ prefixes, clock into
     the task at point and mark it as the default task; the default task
     is always be available with letter ‘d’ when selecting a clocking
     task.  With three ‘C-u C-u C-u’ prefixes, force continuous clocking
     by starting the clock when the last clock stopped.

     While the clock is running, Org shows the current clocking time in
     the mode line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time
     shown is all time ever clocked for this task and its children.  If
     the task has an effort estimate (see *note Effort Estimates::), the
     mode line displays the current clocking time against it(1).  If the
     task is a repeating one (see *note Repeated tasks::), show only the
     time since the last reset of the task(2).  You can exercise more
     control over show time with the ‘CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL’ property.
     It may have the values ‘current’ to show only the current clocking
     instance, ‘today’ to show all time clocked on this tasks today—see
     also the variable ‘org-extend-today-until’, ‘all’ to include all
     time, or ‘auto’ which is the default(3).  Clicking with ‘mouse-1’
     onto the mode line entry pops up a menu with clocking options.

‘C-c C-x C-o’ (‘org-clock-out’)
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     ‘=>HH:MM’.  See the variable ‘org-log-note-clock-out’ for the
     possibility to record an additional note together with the
     clock-out timestamp(4).

‘C-c C-x C-x’ (‘org-clock-in-last’)
     Re-clock the last clocked task.  With one ‘C-u’ prefix argument,
     select the task from the clock history.  With two ‘C-u’ prefixes,
     force continuous clocking by starting the clock when the last clock
     stopped.

‘C-c C-x C-e’ (‘org-clock-modify-effort-estimate’)
     Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.

‘C-c C-c’ or ‘C-c C-y’ (‘org-evaluate-time-range’)
     Recompute the time interval after changing one of the timestamps.
     This is only necessary if you edit the timestamps directly.  If you
     change them with ‘S-<cursor>’ keys, the update is automatic.

‘C-S-<UP>’ (‘org-clock-timestamps-up’)
‘C-S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-clock-timestamps-down’)
     On CLOCK log lines, increase/decrease both timestamps so that the
     clock duration keeps the same value.

‘S-M-<UP>’ (‘org-timestamp-up’)
‘S-M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-timestamp-down’)
     On ‘CLOCK’ log lines, increase/decrease the timestamp at point and
     the one of the previous, or the next, clock timestamp by the same
     duration.  For example, if you hit ‘S-M-<UP>’ to increase a
     clocked-out timestamp by five minutes, then the clocked-in
     timestamp of the next clock is increased by five minutes.

‘C-c C-t’ (‘org-todo’)
     Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
     clock if it is running in this same item.

‘C-c C-x C-q’ (‘org-clock-cancel’)
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.

‘C-c C-x C-j’ (‘org-clock-goto’)
     Jump to the headline of the currently clocked in task.  With a
     ‘C-u’ prefix argument, select the target task from a list of
     recently clocked tasks.

‘C-c C-x C-d’ (‘org-clock-display’)
     Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.
     This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total
     time recorded under that heading, including the time of any
     subheadings.  You can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but
     the overlays disappear when you change the buffer (see variable
     ‘org-remove-highlights-with-change’) or press ‘C-c C-c’.

   The ‘l’ key may be used in the agenda (see *note Weekly/daily
agenda::) to show which tasks have been worked on or closed during a
day.

   *Important:* note that both ‘org-clock-out’ and ‘org-clock-in-last’
can have a global keybinding and do not modify the window disposition.

8.4.2 The clock table
---------------------

Org mode can produce quite complex reports based on the time clocking
information.  Such a report is called a _clock table_, because it is
formatted as one or several Org tables.

‘C-c C-x C-r’ (‘org-clock-report’)
     Insert a dynamic block (see *note Dynamic Blocks::) containing a
     clock report as an Org mode table into the current file.  When
     point is at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called
     with a prefix argument, jump to the first clock report in the
     current document and update it.  The clock table includes archived
     trees.

‘C-c C-c’ or ‘C-c C-x C-u’ (‘org-dblock-update’)
     Update dynamic block at point.  Point needs to be in the ‘BEGIN’
     line of the dynamic block.

‘C-u C-c C-x C-u’
     Update all dynamic blocks (see *note Dynamic Blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.

‘S-<LEFT>’
‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-clocktable-try-shift’)
     Shift the current ‘:block’ interval and update the table.  Point
     needs to be in the ‘#+BEGIN: clocktable’ line for this command.  If
     ‘:block’ is ‘today’, it is shifted to ‘today-1’, etc.

   Here is an example of the frame for a clock table as it is inserted
into the buffer with the ‘C-c C-x C-r’ command:

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file
     #+END: clocktable

   The ‘#+BEGIN’ line and specify a number of options to define the
scope, structure, and formatting of the report.  Defaults for all these
options can be configured in the variable ‘org-clocktable-defaults’.

   First there are options that determine which clock entries are to be
selected:

‘:maxlevel’
     Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.  Clocks
     at deeper levels are summed into the upper level.

‘:scope’
     The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:

     ‘nil’                    the current buffer or narrowed region
     ‘file’                   the full current buffer
     ‘subtree’                the subtree where the clocktable is located
     ‘treeN’                  the surrounding level N tree, for example ‘tree3’
     ‘tree’                   the surrounding level 1 tree
     ‘agenda’                 all agenda files
     ‘("file" ...)’           scan these files
     ‘FUNCTION’               scan files returned by calling FUNCTION with no argument
     ‘file-with-archives’     current file and its archives
     ‘agenda-with-archives’   all agenda files, including archives

‘:block’
     The time block to consider.  This block is specified either
     absolutely, or relative to the current time and may be any of these
     formats:

     ‘2007-12-31’                              New year eve 2007
     ‘2007-12’                                 December 2007
     ‘2007-W50’                                ISO-week 50 in 2007
     ‘2007-Q2’                                 2nd quarter in 2007
     ‘2007’                                    the year 2007
     ‘today’, ‘yesterday’, ‘today-N’           a relative day
     ‘thisweek’, ‘lastweek’, ‘thisweek-N’      a relative week
     ‘thismonth’, ‘lastmonth’, ‘thismonth-N’   a relative month
     ‘thisyear’, ‘lastyear’, ‘thisyear-N’      a relative year
     ‘untilnow’                                all clocked time ever

     When this option is not set, Org falls back to the value in
     ‘org-clock-display-default-range’, which defaults to the current
     year.

     Use ‘S-<LEFT>’ or ‘S-<RIGHT>’ to shift the time interval.

‘:tstart’
     A time string specifying when to start considering times.  Relative
     times like ‘"<-2w>"’ can also be used.  See *note Matching tags and
     properties:: for relative time syntax.

‘:tend’
     A time string specifying when to stop considering times.  Relative
     times like ‘"<now>"’ can also be used.  See *note Matching tags and
     properties:: for relative time syntax.

‘:wstart’
     The starting day of the week.  The default is 1 for Monday.

‘:mstart’
     The starting day of the month.  The default is 1 for the first.

‘:step’
     Set to ‘week’ or ‘day’ to split the table into chunks.  To use
     this, ‘:block’ or ‘:tstart’, ‘:tend’ are needed.

‘:stepskip0’
     Do not show steps that have zero time.

‘:fileskip0’
     Do not show table sections from files which did not contribute.

‘:match’
     A tags match to select entries that should contribute.  See *note
     Matching tags and properties:: for the match syntax.

   Then there are options that determine the formatting of the table.
There options are interpreted by the function
‘org-clocktable-write-default’, but you can specify your own function
using the ‘:formatter’ parameter.

‘:emphasize’
     When ‘t’, emphasize level one and level two items.

‘:lang’
     Language(1) to use for descriptive cells like “Task”.

‘:link’
     Link the item headlines in the table to their origins.

‘:narrow’
     An integer to limit the width of the headline column in the Org
     table.  If you write it like ‘50!’, then the headline is also
     shortened in export.

‘:indent’
     Indent each headline field according to its level.

‘:tcolumns’
     Number of columns to be used for times.  If this is smaller than
     ‘:maxlevel’, lower levels are lumped into one column.

‘:level’
     Should a level number column be included?

‘:sort’
     A cons cell containing the column to sort and a sorting type.
     E.g., ‘:sort (1 . ?a)’ sorts the first column alphabetically.

‘:compact’
     Abbreviation for ‘:level nil :indent t :narrow 40! :tcolumns 1’.
     All are overwritten except if there is an explicit ‘:narrow’.

‘:timestamp’
     A timestamp for the entry, when available.  Look for ‘SCHEDULED’,
     ‘DEADLINE’, ‘TIMESTAMP’ and ‘TIMESTAMP_IA’ special properties (see
     *note Special Properties::), in this order.

‘:tags’
     When this flag is non-‘nil’, show the headline’s tags.

‘:properties’
     List of properties shown in the table.  Each property gets its own
     column.

‘:inherit-props’
     When this flag is non-‘nil’, the values for ‘:properties’ are
     inherited.

‘:formula’
     Content of a ‘TBLFM’ keyword to be added and evaluated.  As a
     special case, ‘:formula %’ adds a column with % time.  If you do
     not specify a formula here, any existing formula below the clock
     table survives updates and is evaluated.

‘:formatter’
     A function to format clock data and insert it into the buffer.

   To get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
day, you could write:

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1 :link t
     #+END: clocktable

To use a specific time range you could write(2)

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                         :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"
     #+END: clocktable

A range starting a week ago and ending right now could be written as

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<-1w>" :tend "<now>"
     #+END: clocktable

A summary of the current subtree with % times would be

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :link t :formula %
     #+END: clocktable

A horizontally compact representation of everything clocked during last
week would be

     #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope agenda :block lastweek :compact t
     #+END: clocktable

‘org-clock-clocktable-language-setup’.

line is broken here only to fit it into the manual.


File: org,  Node: Resolving idle time,  Prev: The clock table,  Up: Clocking Work Time

8.4.3 Resolving idle time and continuous clocking
-------------------------------------------------

Resolving idle time
...................

If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer—perhaps to take a phone call—you often need to “resolve” the
time you were away by either subtracting it from the current clock, or
applying it to another one.

   By customizing the variable ‘org-clock-idle-time’ to some integer,
such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your computer
after being idle for that many minutes(1), and ask what you want to do
with the idle time.  There will be a question waiting for you when you
get back, indicating how much idle time has passed constantly updated
with the current amount, as well as a set of choices to correct the
discrepancy:

‘k’
     To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press ‘k’.
     Org asks how many of the minutes to keep.  Press ‘<RET>’ to keep
     them all, effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep
     that many minutes.

‘K’
     If you use the shift key and press ‘K’, it keeps however many
     minutes you request and then immediately clock out of that task.
     If you keep all of the minutes, this is the same as just clocking
     out of the current task.

‘s’
     To keep none of the minutes, use ‘s’ to subtract all the away time
     from the clock, and then check back in from the moment you
     returned.

‘S’
     To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the
     away time, use the shift key and press ‘S’.  Remember that using
     shift always leave you clocked out, no matter which option you
     choose.

‘C’
     To cancel the clock altogether, use ‘C’.  Note that if instead of
     canceling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock
     amount is less than a minute, the clock is still canceled rather
     than cluttering up the log with an empty entry.

   What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock, and
now want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task
immediately after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have
subtracted time “on the books”, so to speak, and will ask if you want to
apply those minutes to the next task you clock in on.

   There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.
Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased a
mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS’s power button!
You suddenly lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still
have your recent Org mode changes, including your last clock in.

   If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that
you have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last
session.  Using that clock’s starting time as the beginning of the
unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you want to resolve that time.
The logic and behavior is identical to dealing with away time due to
idleness; it is just happening due to a recovery event rather than a set
amount of idle time.

   You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for
dangling clocks at any time using ‘M-x org-resolve-clocks <RET>’ (or
‘C-c C-x C-z’).

Continuous clocking
...................

You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set
‘org-clock-continuously’ to non-‘nil’.  Each time you clock in, Org
retrieves the clock-out time of the last clocked entry for this session,
and start the new clock from there.

   If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix
arguments with ‘org-clock-in’ and two ‘C-u C-u’ with
‘org-clock-in-last’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On computers using macOS, idleness is based on actual user
idleness, not just Emacs’ idle time.  For X11, you can install a utility
program ‘x11idle.c’, available in the ‘contrib/scripts/’ directory of
the Org Git distribution, or install the xprintidle package and set it
to the variable ‘org-clock-x11idle-program-name’ if you are running
Debian, to get the same general treatment of idleness.  On other
systems, idle time refers to Emacs idle time only.


File: org,  Node: Effort Estimates,  Next: Timers,  Prev: Clocking Work Time,  Up: Dates and Times

8.5 Effort Estimates
====================

If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need to
produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you may
want to assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also clocking
your work, you may later want to compare the planned effort with the
actual working time, a great way to improve planning estimates.  Effort
estimates are stored in a special property ‘EFFORT’.  You can set the
effort for an entry with the following commands:

‘C-c C-x e’ (‘org-set-effort’)
     Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a prefix
     argument, set it to the next allowed value—see below.  This command
     is also accessible from the agenda with the ‘e’ key.

‘C-c C-x C-e’ (‘org-clock-modify-effort-estimate’)
     Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.

   Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column
view (see *note Column View::).  You should start by setting up discrete
values for effort estimates, and a ‘COLUMNS’ format that displays these
values together with clock sums—if you want to clock your time.  For a
specific buffer you can use:

     #+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00
     #+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM

or, even better, you can set up these values globally by customizing the
variables ‘org-global-properties’ and ‘org-columns-default-format’.  In
particular if you want to use this setup also in the agenda, a global
setup may be advised.

   The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to
column mode, and to use ‘S-<RIGHT>’ and ‘S-<LEFT>’ to change the value.
The values you enter are immediately summed up in the hierarchy.  In the
column next to it, any clocked time is displayed.

   If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort
column summarizes the estimated work effort for each day(1), and you can
use this to find space in your schedule.  To get an overview of the
entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the option
‘org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum’.  The appointments
on a day that take place over a specified time interval are then also
added to the load estimate of the day.

   Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is
triggered with the ‘/’ key in the agenda (see *note Agenda Commands::).
If you have these estimates defined consistently, two or three key
presses narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an available time
slot.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please note the pitfalls of summing hierarchical data in a flat
list (see *note Agenda Column View::).


File: org,  Node: Timers,  Prev: Effort Estimates,  Up: Dates and Times

8.6 Taking Notes with a Relative Timer
======================================

Org provides two types of timers.  There is a relative timer that counts
up, which can be useful when taking notes during, for example, a meeting
or a video viewing.  There is also a countdown timer.

   The relative and countdown are started with separate commands.

‘C-c C-x 0’ (‘org-timer-start’)
     Start or reset the relative timer.  By default, the timer is set to
     0.  When called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, prompt the user for a starting
     offset.  If there is a timer string at point, this is taken as the
     default, providing a convenient way to restart taking notes after a
     break in the process.  When called with a double prefix argument
     ‘C-u C-u’, change all timer strings in the active region by a
     certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the timer
     was not started at exactly the right moment.

‘C-c C-x ;’ (‘org-timer-set-timer’)
     Start a countdown timer.  The user is prompted for a duration.
     ‘org-timer-default-timer’ sets the default countdown value.  Giving
     a numeric prefix argument overrides this default value.  This
     command is available as ‘;’ in agenda buffers.

   Once started, relative and countdown timers are controlled with the
same commands.

‘C-c C-x .’ (‘org-timer’)
     Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use
     this, the timer starts.  Using a prefix argument restarts it.

‘C-c C-x -’ (‘org-timer-item’)
     Insert a description list item with the current relative time.
     With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.

‘M-<RET>’ (‘org-insert-heading’)
     Once the timer list is started, you can also use ‘M-<RET>’ to
     insert new timer items.

‘C-c C-x ,’ (‘org-timer-pause-or-continue’)
     Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused.

‘C-c C-x _’ (‘org-timer-stop’)
     Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not
     continue the old one.  This command also removes the timer from the
     mode line.

9 Capture, Refile, Archive
**************************

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org does this using a process called _capture_.  It also can
store files related to a task (_attachments_) in a special directory.
Once in the system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving
completed project trees to an archive file keeps the system compact and
fast.

9.1.1 Setting up capture
------------------------

The following customization sets a default target file for notes.

     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))

   You may also define a global key for capturing new material (see
*note Activation::).


File: org,  Node: Using capture,  Next: Capture templates,  Prev: Setting up capture,  Up: Capture

9.1.2 Using capture
-------------------

‘M-x org-capture’ (‘org-capture’)
     Display the capture templates menu.  If you have templates defined
     (see *note Capture templates::), it offers these templates for
     selection or use a new Org outline node as the default template.
     It inserts the template into the target file and switch to an
     indirect buffer narrowed to this new node.  You may then insert the
     information you want.

‘C-c C-c’ (‘org-capture-finalize’)
     Once you have finished entering information into the capture
     buffer, ‘C-c C-c’ returns you to the window configuration before
     the capture process, so that you can resume your work without
     further distraction.  When called with a prefix argument, finalize
     and then jump to the captured item.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-capture-refile’)
     Finalize the capture process by refiling the note to a different
     place (see *note Refile and Copy::).  Please realize that this is a
     normal refiling command that will be executed—so point position at
     the moment you run this command is important.  If you have inserted
     a tree with a parent and children, first move point back to the
     parent.  Any prefix argument given to this command is passed on to
     the ‘org-refile’ command.

‘C-c C-k’ (‘org-capture-kill’)
     Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.

   You can also call ‘org-capture’ in a special way from the agenda,
using the ‘k c’ key combination.  With this access, any timestamps
inserted by the selected capture template defaults to the date at point
in the agenda, rather than to the current date.

   To find the locations of the last stored capture, use ‘org-capture’
with prefix commands:

‘C-u M-x org-capture’
     Visit the target location of a capture template.  You get to select
     the template in the usual way.

‘C-u C-u M-x org-capture’
     Visit the last stored capture item in its buffer.

   You can also jump to the bookmark ‘org-capture-last-stored’, which is
automatically created unless you set ‘org-capture-bookmark’ to ‘nil’.

   To insert the capture at point in an Org buffer, call ‘org-capture’
with a ‘C-0’ prefix argument.


File: org,  Node: Capture templates,  Prev: Using capture,  Up: Capture

9.1.3 Capture templates
-----------------------

You can use templates for different types of capture items, and for
different target locations.  The easiest way to create such templates is
through the customize interface.

‘C’
     Customize the variable ‘org-capture-templates’.

   Before we give the formal description of template definitions, let’s
look at an example.  Say you would like to use one template to create
general TODO entries, and you want to put these entries under the
heading ‘Tasks’ in your file ‘~/org/gtd.org’.  Also, a date tree in the
file ‘journal.org’ should capture journal entries.  A possible
configuration would look like:

     (setq org-capture-templates
           '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
              "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
             ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
              "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))

If you then press ‘t’ from the capture menu, Org will prepare the
template for you like this:

     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU INITIATED CAPTURE]]

During expansion of the template, ‘%a’ has been replaced by a link to
the location from where you called the capture command.  This can be
extremely useful for deriving tasks from emails, for example.  You fill
in the task definition, press ‘C-c C-c’ and Org returns you to the same
place where you started the capture process.

   To define special keys to capture to a particular template without
going through the interactive template selection, you can create your
key binding like this:

     (define-key global-map "\C-cx"
       (lambda () (interactive) (org-capture nil "x")))

* Template expansion::           Filling in information about time and context.
* Templates in contexts::        Only show a template in a specific context.

9.1.3.1 Template elements
.........................

Now lets look at the elements of a template definition.  Each entry in
‘org-capture-templates’ is a list with the following items:

keys
     The keys that selects the template, as a string, characters only,
     for example ‘"a"’, for a template to be selected with a single key,
     or ‘"bt"’ for selection with two keys.  When using several keys,
     keys using the same prefix key must be sequential in the list and
     preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the prefix key, for
     example:

          ("b" "Templates for marking stuff to buy")

     If you do not define a template for the ‘C’ key, this key opens the
     Customize buffer for this complex variable.

description
     A short string describing the template, shown during selection.

type
     The type of entry, a symbol.  Valid values are:

     ‘entry’
          An Org mode node, with a headline.  Will be filed as the child
          of the target entry or as a top-level entry.  The target file
          should be an Org file.

     ‘item’
          A plain list item, placed in the first plain list at the
          target location.  Again the target file should be an Org file.

     ‘checkitem’
          A checkbox item.  This only differs from the plain list item
          by the default template.

     ‘table-line’
          A new line in the first table at the target location.  Where
          exactly the line will be inserted depends on the properties
          ‘:prepend’ and ‘:table-line-pos’ (see below).

     ‘plain’
          Text to be inserted as it is.

target
     Specification of where the captured item should be placed.  In Org
     files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will become children
     of this node.  Other types will be added to the table or list in
     the body of this node.  Most target specifications contain a file
     name.  If that file name is the empty string, it defaults to
     ‘org-default-notes-file’.  A file can also be given as a variable
     or as a function called with no argument.  When an absolute path is
     not specified for a target, it is taken as relative to
     ‘org-directory’.

     Valid values are:

     ‘(file "path/to/file")’
          Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file.

     ‘(id "id of existing org entry")’
          Filing as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry.

     ‘(file+headline "filename" "node headline")’
          Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the
          file.

     ‘(file+olp "filename" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)’
          For non-unique headings, the full path is safer.

     ‘(file+regexp "filename" "regexp to find location")’
          Use a regular expression to position point.

     ‘(file+olp+datetree "filename" [ "Level 1 heading" ...])’
          This target(1) creates a heading in a date tree(2) for today’s
          date.  If the optional outline path is given, the tree will be
          built under the node it is pointing to, instead of at top
          level.  Check out the ‘:time-prompt’ and ‘:tree-type’
          properties below for additional options.

     ‘(file+function "filename" function-finding-location)’
          A function to find the right location in the file.

     ‘(clock)’
          File to the entry that is currently being clocked.

     ‘(function function-finding-location)’
          Most general way: write your own function which both visits
          the file and moves point to the right location.

template
     The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this
     empty, an appropriate default template will be used.  Otherwise
     this is a string with escape codes, which will be replaced
     depending on time and context of the capture call.  The string with
     escapes may be loaded from a template file, using the special
     syntax ‘(file "template filename")’.  See below for more details.

properties
     The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.
     Recognized properties are:

     ‘:prepend’
          Normally new captured information will be appended at the
          target location (last child, last table line, last list item,
          ...).  Setting this property changes that.

     ‘:immediate-finish’
          When set, do not offer to edit the information, just file it
          away immediately.  This makes sense if the template only needs
          information that can be added automatically.

     ‘:empty-lines’
          Set this to the number of lines to insert before and after the
          new item.  Default 0, and the only other common value is 1.

     ‘:clock-in’
          Start the clock in this item.

     ‘:clock-keep’
          Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

     ‘:clock-resume’
          If starting the capture interrupted a clock, restart that
          clock when finished with the capture.  Note that ‘:clock-keep’
          has precedence over ‘:clock-resume’.  When setting both to
          non-‘nil’, the current clock will run and the previous one
          will not be resumed.

     ‘:time-prompt’
          Prompt for a date/time to be used for date/week trees and when
          filling the template.  Without this property, capture uses the
          current date and time.  Even if this property has not been
          set, you can force the same behavior by calling ‘org-capture’
          with a ‘C-1’ prefix argument.

     ‘:tree-type’
          When ‘week’, make a week tree instead of the month tree, i.e.,
          place the headings for each day under a heading with the
          current ISO week.

     ‘:unnarrowed’
          Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the full buffer.
          Default is to narrow it so that you only see the new material.

     ‘:table-line-pos’
          Specification of the location in the table where the new line
          should be inserted.  It should be a string like ‘II-3’ meaning
          that the new line should become the third line before the
          second horizontal separator line.

     ‘:kill-buffer’
          If the target file was not yet visited when capture was
          invoked, kill the buffer again after capture is completed.

     ‘:no-save’
          Do not save the target file after finishing the capture.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org used to offer four different targets for date/week tree
capture.  Now, Org automatically translates these to use
‘file+olp+datetree’, applying the ‘:time-prompt’ and ‘:tree-type’
properties.  Please rewrite your date/week-tree targets using
‘file+olp+datetree’ since the older targets are now deprecated.

   (2) A date tree is an outline structure with years on the highest
level, months or ISO weeks as sublevels and then dates on the lowest
level.  Tags are allowed in the tree structure.


File: org,  Node: Template expansion,  Next: Templates in contexts,  Prev: Template elements,  Up: Capture templates

9.1.3.2 Template expansion
..........................

In the template itself, special “%-escapes”(1) allow dynamic insertion
of content.  The templates are expanded in the order given here:

‘%[FILE]’
     Insert the contents of the file given by FILE.

‘%(EXP)’
     Evaluate Elisp expression EXP and replace it with the result.  The
     EXP form must return a string.  Only placeholders pre-existing
     within the template, or introduced with ‘%[file]’, are expanded
     this way.  Since this happens after expanding non-interactive
     “%-escapes”, those can be used to fill the expression.

‘%<FORMAT>’
     The result of format-time-string on the FORMAT specification.

‘%t’
     Timestamp, date only.

‘%T’
     Timestamp, with date and time.

‘%u’, ‘%U’
     Like ‘%t’, ‘%T’ above, but inactive timestamps.

‘%i’
     Initial content, the region when capture is called while the region
     is active.  If there is text before ‘%i’ on the same line, such as
     indentation, and ‘%i’ is not inside a ‘%(exp)’ form, that prefix is
     added before every line in the inserted text.

‘%a’
     Annotation, normally the link created with ‘org-store-link’.

‘%A’
     Like ‘%a’, but prompt for the description part.

‘%l’
     Like ‘%a’, but only insert the literal link.

‘%c’
     Current kill ring head.

‘%x’
     Content of the X clipboard.

‘%k’
     Title of the currently clocked task.

‘%K’
     Link to the currently clocked task.

‘%n’
     User name (taken from ‘user-full-name’).

‘%f’
     File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.

‘%F’
     Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.

‘%:keyword’
     Specific information for certain link types, see below.

‘%^g’
     Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.

‘%^G’
     Prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.

‘%^t’
     Like ‘%t’, but prompt for date.  Similarly ‘%^T’, ‘%^u’, ‘%^U’.
     You may define a prompt like ‘%^{Birthday}t’.

‘%^C’
     Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.

‘%^L’
     Like ‘%^C’, but insert as link.

‘%^{PROP}p’
     Prompt the user for a value for property PROP.

‘%^{PROMPT}’
     Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
     You may specify a default value and a completion table with
     ‘%^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}’.  The arrow keys
     access a prompt-specific history.

‘%\N’
     Insert the text entered at the Nth ‘%^{PROMPT}’, where N is a
     number, starting from 1.

‘%?’
     After completing the template, position point here.

   For specific link types, the following keywords are defined(2):

Link type      Available keywords
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
bbdb           ‘%:name’, ‘%:company’
irc            ‘%:server’, ‘%:port’, ‘%:nick’
mh, rmail      ‘%:type’, ‘%:subject’, ‘%:message-id’
               ‘%:from’, ‘%:fromname’, ‘%:fromaddress’
               ‘%:to’, ‘%:toname’, ‘%:toaddress’
               ‘%:date’ (message date header field)
               ‘%:date-timestamp’ (date as active timestamp)
               ‘%:date-timestamp-inactive’ (date as inactive timestamp)
               ‘%:fromto’ (either “to NAME” or “from NAME”)(3)
gnus           ‘%:group’, for messages also all email fields
w3, w3m        ‘%:url’
info           ‘%:file’, ‘%:node’
calendar       ‘%:date’
org-protocol   ‘%:link’, ‘%:description’, ‘%:annotation’

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you need one of these sequences literally, escape the ‘%’ with
a backslash.

   (2) If you define your own link types (see *note Adding Hyperlink
Types::), any property you store with ‘org-store-link-props’ can be
accessed in capture templates in a similar way.

   (3) This is always the other, not the user.  See the variable
‘org-from-is-user-regexp’.


File: org,  Node: Templates in contexts,  Prev: Template expansion,  Up: Capture templates

9.1.3.3 Templates in contexts
.............................

To control whether a capture template should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize ‘org-capture-templates-contexts’.
Let’s say, for example, that you have a capture template “p” for storing
Gnus emails containing patches.  Then you would configure this option
like this:

     (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
           '(("p" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   You can also tell that the command key ‘p’ should refer to another
template.  In that case, add this command key like this:

     (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
           '(("p" "q" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   See the docstring of the variable for more information.


File: org,  Node: Attachments,  Next: RSS Feeds,  Prev: Capture,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.2 Attachments
===============

It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline
node/task.  Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the
subtree of a project.  Hyperlinks (see *note Hyperlinks::) can establish
associations with files that live elsewhere on your computer or in the
cloud, like emails or source code files belonging to a project.  Another
method is _attachments_, which are files located in a directory
belonging to an outline node.  Org uses directories named by the unique
ID of each entry.  These directories are located in the ‘data/’
directory which lives in the same directory where your Org file
lives(1).  If you initialize this directory with ‘git init’, Org
automatically commits changes when it sees them.  The attachment system
has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

   In cases where it seems better to do so, you can attach a directory
of your choice to an entry.  You can also make children inherit the
attachment directory from a parent, so that an entire subtree uses the
same attached directory.

   The following commands deal with attachments:

‘C-c C-a’ (‘org-attach’)
     The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.
     After these keys, a list of commands is displayed and you must
     press an additional key to select a command:

     ‘a’ (‘org-attach-attach’)
          Select a file and move it into the task’s attachment
          directory.  The file is copied, moved, or linked, depending on
          ‘org-attach-method’.  Note that hard links are not supported
          on all systems.

     ‘c’/‘m’/‘l’
          Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.  Note that hard
          links are not supported on all systems.

     ‘n’ (‘org-attach-new’)
          Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

     ‘z’ (‘org-attach-sync’)
          Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory, in
          case you added attachments yourself.

     ‘o’ (‘org-attach-open’)
          Open current task’s attachment.  If there is more than one,
          prompt for a file name first.  Opening follows the rules set
          by ‘org-file-apps’.  For more details, see the information on
          following hyperlinks (see *note Handling Links::).

     ‘O’ (‘org-attach-open-in-emacs’)
          Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

     ‘f’ (‘org-attach-reveal’)
          Open the current task’s attachment directory.

     ‘F’ (‘org-attach-reveal-in-emacs’)
          Also open the directory, but force using Dired in Emacs.

     ‘d’ (‘org-attach-delete-one’)
          Select and delete a single attachment.

     ‘D’ (‘org-attach-delete-all’)
          Delete all of a task’s attachments.  A safer way is to open
          the directory in Dired and delete from there.

     ‘s’ (‘org-attach-set-directory’)
          Set a specific directory as the entry’s attachment directory.
          This works by putting the directory path into the ‘ATTACH_DIR’
          property.

     ‘i’ (‘org-attach-set-inherit’)
          Set the ‘ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT’ property, so that children use
          the same directory for attachments as the parent does.

   It is possible to attach files to a subtree from a Dired buffer.  To
use this feature, have one window in Dired mode containing the file(s)
to be attached and another window with point in the subtree that shall
get the attachments.  In the Dired window, with point on a file, ‘M-x
org-attach-dired-to-subtree’ attaches the file to the subtree using the
attachment method set by variable ‘org-attach-method’.  When files are
marked in the Dired window then all marked files get attached.

   Add the following lines to the Emacs init file to have ‘C-c C-x a’
attach files in Dired buffers.

     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (define-key dired-mode-map
                   (kbd "C-c C-x a")
                   #'org-attach-dired-to-subtree))))

   The following code shows how to bind the previous command with a
specific attachment method.

     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-x c")
                   (lambda ()
                     (interactive)
                     (let ((org-attach-method 'cp))
                       (call-interactively #'org-attach-dired-to-subtree))))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you move entries or Org files from one directory to another,
you may want to configure ‘org-attach-directory’ to contain an absolute
path.


File: org,  Node: RSS Feeds,  Next: Protocols,  Prev: Attachments,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.3 RSS Feeds
=============

Org can add and change entries based on information found in RSS feeds
and Atom feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new
podcast in a podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based note-creating
service on the web to import tasks into Org.  To access feeds, configure
the variable ‘org-feed-alist’.  The docstring of this variable has
detailed information.  With the following

     (setq org-feed-alist
           '(("Slashdot"
              "http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot"
              "~/txt/org/feeds.org" "Slashdot Entries")))

new items from the feed provided by ‘rss.slashdot.org’ result in new
entries in the file ‘~/org/feeds.org’ under the heading ‘Slashdot
Entries’, whenever the following command is used:

‘C-c C-x g’ (‘org-feed-update-all’)
     Collect items from the feeds configured in ‘org-feed-alist’ and act
     upon them.

‘C-c C-x G’ (‘org-feed-goto-inbox’)
     Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this
     feed.

   Under the same headline, Org creates a drawer ‘FEEDSTATUS’ in which
it stores information about the status of items in the feed, to avoid
adding the same item several times.

   For more information, including how to read atom feeds, see
‘org-feed.el’ and the docstring of ‘org-feed-alist’.


File: org,  Node: Protocols,  Next: Refile and Copy,  Prev: RSS Feeds,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.4 Protocols for External Access
=================================

Org protocol is a means to trigger custom actions in Emacs from external
applications.  Any application that supports calling external programs
with an URL as argument may be used with this functionality.  For
example, you can configure bookmarks in your web browser to send a link
to the current page to Org and create a note from it using capture (see
*note Capture::).  You can also create a bookmark that tells Emacs to
open the local source file of a remote website you are browsing.

   In order to use Org protocol from an application, you need to
register ‘org-protocol://’ as a valid scheme-handler.  External calls
are passed to Emacs through the ‘emacsclient’ command, so you also need
to ensure an Emacs server is running.  More precisely, when the
application calls

     emacsclient org-protocol://PROTOCOL?key1=val1&key2=val2

Emacs calls the handler associated to PROTOCOL with argument ‘(:key1
val1 :key2 val2)’.

   Org protocol comes with three predefined protocols, detailed in the
following sections.  Configure ‘org-protocol-protocol-alist’ to define
your own.

* Menu:

* store-link protocol::   Store a link, push URL to kill-ring.
* capture protocol::      Fill a buffer with external information.
* open-source protocol::  Edit published contents.


File: org,  Node: store-link protocol,  Next: capture protocol,  Up: Protocols

9.4.1 ‘store-link’ protocol
---------------------------

Using ‘store-link’ handler, you can copy links, insertable through ‘M-x
org-insert-link’ or yanking thereafter.  More precisely, the command

     emacsclient org-protocol://store-link?url=URL&title=TITLE

stores the following link:

     [[URL][TITLE]]

   In addition, URL is pushed on the kill-ring for yanking.  You need to
encode URL and TITLE if they contain slashes, and probably quote those
for the shell.

   To use this feature from a browser, add a bookmark with an arbitrary
name, e.g., ‘Org: store-link’ and enter this as _Location_:

     javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link?url='+
           encodeURIComponent(location.href);


File: org,  Node: capture protocol,  Next: open-source protocol,  Prev: store-link protocol,  Up: Protocols

9.4.2 ‘capture’ protocol
------------------------

Activating “capture” handler pops up a ‘Capture’ buffer and fills the
capture template associated to the ‘X’ key with them.

     emacsclient org-protocol://capture?template=X?url=URL?title=TITLE?body=BODY

   To use this feature, add a bookmark with an arbitrary name, e.g.,
‘Org: capture’, and enter this as ‘Location’:

     javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture?template=x'+
           '&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)+
           '&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+
           '&body='+encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection());

   The result depends on the capture template used, which is set in the
bookmark itself, as in the example above, or in
‘org-protocol-default-template-key’.

   The following template placeholders are available:

     %:link          The URL
     %:description   The webpage title
     %:annotation    Equivalent to [[%:link][%:description]]
     %i              The selected text


File: org,  Node: open-source protocol,  Prev: capture protocol,  Up: Protocols

9.4.3 ‘open-source’ protocol
----------------------------

The ‘open-source’ handler is designed to help with editing local sources
when reading a document.  To that effect, you can use a bookmark with
the following location:

     javascript:location.href='org-protocol://open-source?&url='+
           encodeURIComponent(location.href)

   The variable ‘org-protocol-project-alist’ maps URLs to local file
names, by stripping URL parameters from the end and replacing the
‘:base-url’ with ‘:working-directory’ and ‘:online-suffix’ with
‘:working-suffix’.  For example, assuming you own a local copy of
‘https://orgmode.org/worg/’ contents at ‘/home/user/worg’, you can set
‘org-protocol-project-alist’ to the following

     (setq org-protocol-project-alist
           '(("Worg"
              :base-url "https://orgmode.org/worg/"
              :working-directory "/home/user/worg/"
              :online-suffix ".html"
              :working-suffix ".org")))

‘https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html’ and find a typo
or have an idea about how to enhance the documentation, simply click the
bookmark and start editing.

   However, such mapping may not yield the desired results.  Suppose you
maintain an online store located at ‘http://example.com/’.  The local
sources reside in ‘/home/user/example/’.  It is common practice to serve
all products in such a store through one file and rewrite URLs that do
not match an existing file on the server.  That way, a request to
‘http://example.com/print/posters.html’ might be rewritten on the server
to something like
‘http://example.com/shop/products.php/posters.html.php’.  The
‘open-source’ handler probably cannot find a file named
‘/home/user/example/print/posters.html.php’ and fails.

   Such an entry in ‘org-protocol-project-alist’ may hold an additional
property ‘:rewrites’.  This property is a list of cons cells, each of
which maps a regular expression to a path relative to the
‘:working-directory’.

   Now map the URL to the path ‘/home/user/example/products.php’ by
adding ‘:rewrites’ rules like this:

     (setq org-protocol-project-alist
           '(("example.com"
              :base-url "http://example.com/"
              :working-directory "/home/user/example/"
              :online-suffix ".php"
              :working-suffix ".php"
              :rewrites (("example.com/print/" . "products.php")
                         ("example.com/$" . "index.php")))))

Since ‘example.com/$’ is used as a regular expression, it maps
‘http://example.com/’, ‘https://example.com’, ‘http://www.example.com/’
and similar to ‘/home/user/example/index.php’.

   The ‘:rewrites’ rules are searched as a last resort if and only if no
existing file name is matched.

   Two functions can help you filling ‘org-protocol-project-alist’ with
valid contents: ‘org-protocol-create’ and ‘org-protocol-create-for-org’.
The latter is of use if you’re editing an Org file that is part of a
publishing project.


File: org,  Node: Refile and Copy,  Next: Archiving,  Prev: Protocols,  Up: Capture Refile Archive

9.5 Refile and Copy
===================

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy some
of the entries into a different list, for example into a project.
Cutting, finding the right location, and then pasting the note is
cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following special
command:

‘C-c M-w’ (‘org-copy’)
     Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not
     deleted.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile’)
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
     ‘org-reverse-note-order’, it is either the first or last subitem.

     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex definitions
     across a number of files.  See the variable ‘org-refile-targets’
     for details.  If you would like to select a location via a
     file-path-like completion along the outline path, see the variables
     ‘org-refile-use-outline-path’ and
     ‘org-outline-path-complete-in-steps’.  If you would like to be able
     to create new nodes as new parents for refiling on the fly, check
     the variable ‘org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes’.  When the
     variable ‘org-log-refile’(1) is set, a timestamp or a note is
     recorded whenever an entry is refiled.

‘C-u C-c C-w’
     Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.

‘C-u C-u C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile-goto-last-stored’)
     Jump to the location where ‘org-refile’ last moved a tree to.

‘C-2 C-c C-w’
     Refile as the child of the item currently being clocked.

‘C-3 C-c C-w’
     Refile and keep the entry in place.  Also see ‘org-refile-keep’ to
     make this the default behavior, and beware that this may result in
     duplicated ‘ID’ properties.

‘C-0 C-c C-w’ or ‘C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w’ (‘org-refile-cache-clear’)
     Clear the target cache.  Caching of refile targets can be turned on
     by setting ‘org-refile-use-cache’.  To make the command see new
     possible targets, you have to clear the cache with this command.

   (1) Note the corresponding ‘STARTUP’ options ‘logrefile’,
‘lognoterefile’, and ‘nologrefile’.

9.6 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Archiving is important to keep your working files compact and
global searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

‘C-c C-x C-a’ (‘org-archive-subtree-default’)
     Archive the current entry using the command specified in the
     variable ‘org-archive-default-command’.

* Menu:

* Moving subtrees::              Moving a tree to an archive file.
* Internal archiving::           Switch off a tree but keep it in the file.


File: org,  Node: Moving subtrees,  Next: Internal archiving,  Up: Archiving

9.6.1 Moving a tree to an archive file
--------------------------------------

The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another
file, the archive file.

‘C-c C-x C-s’ or short ‘C-c $’ (‘org-archive-subtree’)
     Archive the subtree starting at point position to the location
     given by ‘org-archive-location’.

‘C-u C-c C-x C-s’
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be moved
     to the archive.  To do this, check each subtree for open TODO
     entries.  If none is found, the command offers to move it to the
     archive location.  If point is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, check level 1 trees.

‘C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s’
     As above, but check subtree for timestamps instead of TODO entries.
     The command offers to archive the subtree if it _does_ contain a
     timestamp, and that timestamp is in the past.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending ‘_archive’ to the
current file name.  You can also choose what heading to file archived
items under, with the possibility to add them to a datetree in a file.
For information and examples on how to specify the file and the heading,
see the documentation string of the variable ‘org-archive-location’.

   There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example:

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

   If you would like to have a special archive location for a single
entry or a (sub)tree, give the entry an ‘ARCHIVE’ property with the
location as the value (see *note Properties and Columns::).

   When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties
that record context information like the file from where the entry came,
its outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
‘org-archive-save-context-info’ to adjust the amount of information
added.


File: org,  Node: Internal archiving,  Prev: Moving subtrees,  Up: Archiving

9.6.2 Internal archiving
------------------------

If you want to just switch off—for agenda views—certain subtrees without
moving them to a different file, you can use the ‘ARCHIVE’ tag.

   A headline that is marked with the ‘ARCHIVE’ tag (see *note Tags::)
stays at its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following
way:

   • It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility
     cycling command (see *note Visibility Cycling::).  You can force
     cycling archived subtrees with ‘C-<TAB>’, or by setting the option
     ‘org-cycle-open-archived-trees’.  Also normal outline commands,
     like ‘outline-show-all’, open archived subtrees.

   • During sparse tree construction (see *note Sparse Trees::), matches
     in archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the
     option ‘org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees’.

   • During agenda view construction (see *note Agenda Views::), the
     content of archived trees is ignored unless you configure the
     option ‘org-agenda-skip-archived-trees’, in which case these trees
     are always included.  In the agenda you can press ‘v a’ to get
     archives temporarily included.

   • Archived trees are not exported (see *note Exporting::), only the
     headline is.  Configure the details using the variable
     ‘org-export-with-archived-trees’.

   • Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
     ‘org-columns-skip-archived-trees’ is configured to ‘nil’.

   The following commands help manage the ‘ARCHIVE’ tag:

‘C-c C-x a’ (‘org-toggle-archive-tag’)
     Toggle the archive tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree below
     it is hidden.

‘C-u C-c C-x a’
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, check each subtree for open TODO entries.
     If none is found, the command offers to set the ‘ARCHIVE’ tag for
     the child.  If point is _not_ on a headline when this command is
     invoked, check the level 1 trees.

‘C-<TAB>’ (‘org-force-cycle-archived’)
     Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ‘ARCHIVE’.

‘C-c C-x A’ (‘org-archive-to-archive-sibling’)
     Move the current entry to the _Archive Sibling_.  This is a sibling
     of the entry with the heading ‘Archive’ and the archive tag.  The
     entry becomes a child of that sibling and in this way retains a lot
     of its original context, including inherited tags and approximate
     position in the outline.

10 Agenda Views
***************

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.
To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are important
for a particular date, this information must be collected, sorted and
displayed in an organized way.

   Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a
separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

   • an _agenda_ that is like a calendar and shows information for
     specific dates,

   • a _TODO list_ that covers all unfinished action items,

   • a _match view_, showings headlines based on the tags, properties,
     and TODO state associated with them,

   • a _text search view_ that shows all entries from multiple files
     that contain specified keywords,

   • a _stuck projects view_ showing projects that currently do not move
     along, and

   • _custom views_ that are special searches and combinations of
     different views.

   The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to edit
these files remotely.

   By default, the report ignores commented (see *note Comment Lines::)
and archived (see *note Internal archiving::) entries.  You can override
this by setting ‘org-agenda-skip-comment-trees’ and
‘org-agenda-skip-archived-trees’ to ‘nil’.

   Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
‘org-agenda-window-setup’ and ‘org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit’.

* Menu:

* Agenda Files::                 Files being searched for agenda information.
* Agenda Dispatcher::            Keyboard access to agenda views.
* Built-in Agenda Views::        What is available out of the box?
* Presentation and Sorting::     How agenda items are prepared for display.

File: org,  Node: Agenda Files,  Next: Agenda Dispatcher,  Up: Agenda Views

10.1 Agenda Files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable ‘org-agenda-files’(1).  If a
directory is part of this list, all files with the extension ‘.org’ in
this directory are part of the list.

   Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list(2).  You can customize ‘org-agenda-files’, but the
easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

‘C-c [’ (‘org-agenda-file-to-front’)
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the
     end.

‘C-c ]’ (‘org-remove-file’)
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.

‘C-'’
‘C-,’ (‘org-cycle-agenda-files’)
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.

‘M-x org-switchb’
     Command to use an iswitchb-like interface to switch to and between
     Org buffers.

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used to visit
any of them.

   If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree in
a file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single agenda
command, you may press ‘<’ once or several times in the dispatcher (see
*note Agenda Dispatcher::).  To restrict the agenda scope for an
extended period, use the following commands:

‘C-c C-x <’ (‘org-agenda-set-restriction-lock’)
     Restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  If there already is a
     restriction at point, remove it.  When called with a universal
     prefix argument or with point before the first headline in a file,
     set the agenda scope to the entire file.  This restriction remains
     in effect until removed with ‘C-c C-x >’, or by typing either ‘<’
     or ‘>’ in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is a window displaying
     an agenda view, the new restriction takes effect immediately.

‘C-c C-x >’ (‘org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock’)
     Remove the restriction created by ‘C-c C-x <’.

   When working with Speedbar, you can use the following commands in the
Speedbar frame:

‘<’ (‘org-speedbar-set-agenda-restriction’)
     Restrict the agenda to the item—either an Org file or a subtree in
     such a file—at point in the Speedbar frame.  If agenda is already
     restricted there, remove the restriction.  If there is a window
     displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes effect
     immediately.

‘>’ (‘org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock’)
     Remove the restriction.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files in maintained in that external file.

   (2) When using the dispatcher, pressing ‘<’ before selecting a
command actually limits the command to the current file, and ignores
‘org-agenda-files’ until the next dispatcher command.

10.2 The Agenda Dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher, accessible with ‘M-x
org-agenda’, or, better, bound to a global key (see *note Activation::).
It displays a menu from which an additional letter is required to
execute a command.  The dispatcher offers the following default
commands:

‘a’
     Create the calendar-like agenda (see *note Weekly/daily agenda::).

‘t’ or ‘T’
     Create a list of all TODO items (see *note Global TODO list::).

‘m’ or ‘M’
     Create a list of headlines matching a given expression (see *note
     Matching tags and properties::).

‘s’
     Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of
     keywords and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in
     the entry.

‘/’
     Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and
     additionally in the files listed in
     ‘org-agenda-text-search-extra-files’.  This uses the Emacs command
     ‘multi-occur’.  A prefix argument can be used to specify the number
     of context lines for each match, default is
       1. 
‘#’ or ‘!’
     Create a list of stuck projects (see *note Stuck projects::).

‘<’
     Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer(1).  After
     pressing ‘<’, you still need to press the character selecting the
     command.

‘< <’
     If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda command
     to the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current subtree(2).
     After pressing ‘< <’, you still need to press the character
     selecting the command.

‘*’
     Toggle sticky agenda views.  By default, Org maintains only a
     single agenda buffer and rebuilds it each time you change the view,
     to make sure everything is always up to date.  If you switch
     between views often and the build time bothers you, you can turn on
     sticky agenda buffers (make this the default by customizing the
     variable ‘org-agenda-sticky’).  With sticky agendas, the dispatcher
     only switches to the selected view, you need to update it by hand
     with ‘r’ or ‘g’.  You can toggle sticky agenda view any time with
     ‘org-toggle-sticky-agenda’.

   You can also define custom commands that are accessible through the
dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  See *note Custom Agenda Views::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, you can also press ‘1’ to restrict to
the current buffer.

   (2) For backward compatibility, you can also press ‘0’ to restrict to
the current region/subtree.

10.3 The Built-in Agenda Views
==============================

In this section we describe the built-in views.

* Stuck projects::               Find projects you need to review.


File: org,  Node: Weekly/daily agenda,  Next: Global TODO list,  Up: Built-in Agenda Views

10.3.1 Weekly/daily agenda
--------------------------

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

‘M-x org-agenda a’ (‘org-agenda-list’)
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric prefix
     argument(1)—like ‘C-u 2 1 M-x org-agenda a’—you may set the number
     of days to be displayed.

   The default number of days displayed in the agenda is set by the
variable ‘org-agenda-span’.  This variable can be set to any number of
days you want to see by default in the agenda, or to a span name, such a
‘day’, ‘week’, ‘month’ or ‘year’.  For weekly agendas, the default is to
start on the previous Monday (see ‘org-agenda-start-on-weekday’).  You
can also set the start date using a date shift: ‘(setq
org-agenda-start-day "+10d")’ starts the agenda ten days from today in
the future.

   Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you
can change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda
buffer.  The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in *note
Agenda Commands::.

Calendar/Diary integration
..........................

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with the diary.

   In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode’s
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

After that, everything happens automatically.  All diary entries
including holidays, anniversaries, etc., are included in the agenda
buffer created by Org mode.  ‘<SPC>’, ‘<TAB>’, and ‘<RET>’ can be used
from the agenda buffer to jump to the diary file in order to edit
existing diary entries.  The ‘i’ command to insert new entries for the
current date works in the agenda buffer, as well as the commands ‘S’,
‘M’, and ‘C’ to display Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to
convert to other calendars, respectively.  ‘c’ can be used to switch
back and forth between calendar and agenda.

   If you are using the diary only for S-exp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file.  Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them, as seen in the
following segment of an Org file:(2)

     * Holidays
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Holiday
       :END:
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names

     * Birthdays
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Ann
       :END:
     %%(org-anniversary 1956  5 14) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(org-anniversary 1869 10  2) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

Anniversaries from BBDB
.......................

If you are using the Insidious Big Brother Database to store your
contacts, you very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather
than in a separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and can show
BBDB anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add
the following to one of your agenda files:

     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END:
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)

   You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.
Basically, you need a field named ‘anniversary’ for the BBDB record
which contains the date in the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ or ‘MM-DD’, followed
by a space and the class of the anniversary (‘birthday’, ‘wedding’, or a
format string).  If you omit the class, it defaults to ‘birthday’.  Here
are a few examples, the header for the file ‘org-bbdb.el’ contains more
detailed information.

     1973-06-22
     06-22
     1955-08-02 wedding
     2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of Org mode, %d years ago

   After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an
Emacs session, the agenda display suffers a short delay as Org updates
its hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will be very
fast, much faster in fact than a long list of ‘%%(diary-anniversary)’
entries in an Org or Diary file.

   If you would like to see upcoming anniversaries with a bit of
forewarning, you can use the following instead:

     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END:
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries-future 3)

   That will give you three days’ warning: on the anniversary date
itself and the two days prior.  The argument is optional: if omitted, it
defaults to 7.

Appointment reminders
.....................

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add
the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
‘org-agenda-to-appt’.  This command lets you filter through the list of
your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific category or
matching a regular expression.  It also reads a ‘APPT_WARNTIME’ property
which overrides the value of ‘appt-message-warning-time’ for this
appointment.  See the docstring for details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the universal prefix argument ‘C-u’
causes all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This feature is
deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda instead (see
*note Block agenda::).

   (2) The variable ‘org-anniversary’ used in the example is just like
‘diary-anniversary’, but the argument order is always according to ISO
and therefore independent of the value of ‘calendar-date-style’.

10.3.2 The global TODO list
---------------------------

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

‘M-x org-agenda t’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (see *note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  By
     default, this lists items with a state the is not a DONE state.
     The buffer is in ‘agenda-mode’, so there are commands to examine
     and manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (see
     *note Agenda Commands::).

‘M-x org-agenda T’ (‘org-todo-list’)
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.
     You can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to ‘t’.  You
     are prompted for a keyword, and you may also specify several
     keywords by separating them with ‘|’ as the boolean OR operator.
     With a numeric prefix, the Nth keyword in ‘org-todo-keywords’ is
     selected.

     The ‘r’ key in the agenda buffer regenerates it, and you can give a
     prefix argument to this command to change the selected TODO
     keyword, for example ‘3 r’.  If you often need a search for a
     specific keyword, define a custom command for it (see *note Agenda
     Dispatcher::).

     Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
     search (see *note Tag Searches::).

   Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the TODO
list are described in *note Agenda Commands::.

   Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:

   • Some people view a TODO item that has been _scheduled_ for
     execution or have a _deadline_ (see *note Timestamps::) as no
     longer _open_.  Configure the variables
     ‘org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled’,
     ‘org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines’,
     ‘org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp’ and/or
     ‘org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date’ to exclude such items from the
     global TODO list.

   • TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.
     In such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
     headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure
     the variable ‘org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels’ to get this behavior.

10.3.3 Matching tags and properties
-----------------------------------

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (see *note
Tags::), or have properties (see *note Properties and Columns::), you
can select headlines based on this metadata and collect them into an
agenda buffer.  The match syntax described here also applies when
creating sparse trees with ‘C-c / m’.

‘M-x org-agenda m’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like ‘+work+urgent-withboss’ or
     ‘work|home’ (see *note Tags::).  If you often need a specific
     search, define a custom command for it (see *note Agenda
     Dispatcher::).

‘M-x org-agenda M’ (‘org-tags-view’)
     Like ‘m’, but only select headlines that are also TODO items and
     force checking subitems (see the variable
     ‘org-tags-match-list-sublevels’).  To exclude scheduled/deadline
     items, see the variable
     ‘org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options’.  Matching specific
     TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible, see
     *note Tag Searches::.

   The commands available in the tags list are described in *note Agenda
Commands::.

   A search string can use Boolean operators ‘&’ for AND and ‘|’ for OR.
‘&’ binds more strongly than ‘|’.  Parentheses are currently not
implemented.  Each element in the search is either a tag, a regular
expression matching tags, or an expression like ‘PROPERTY OPERATOR
VALUE’ with a comparison operator, accessing a property value.  Each
element may be preceded by ‘-’ to select against it, and ‘+’ is
syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The AND operator ‘&’ is
optional when ‘+’ or ‘-’ is present.  Here are some examples, using only
tags.

‘+work-boss’
     Select headlines tagged ‘work’, but discard those also tagged
     ‘boss’.

‘work|laptop’
     Selects lines tagged ‘work’ or ‘laptop’.

‘work|laptop+night’
     Like before, but require the ‘laptop’ lines to be tagged also
     ‘night’.

   Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
in curly braces.  For example, ‘work+{^boss.*}’ matches headlines that
contain the tag ‘:work:’ and any tag _starting_ with ‘boss’.

   Group tags (see *note Tag Hierarchy::) are expanded as regular
expressions.  E.g., if ‘work’ is a group tag for the group
‘:work:lab:conf:’, then searching for ‘work’ also searches for
‘{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)}’ and searching for ‘-work’ searches for all
headlines but those with one of the tags in the group (i.e.,
‘-{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)}’).

   You may also test for properties (see *note Properties and Columns::)
at the same time as matching tags.  The properties may be real
properties, or special properties that represent other metadata (see
*note Special Properties::).  For example, the property ‘TODO’
represents the TODO keyword of the entry.  Or, the property ‘LEVEL’
represents the level of an entry.  So searching
‘+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO​="DONE"’ lists all level three headlines that have
the tag ‘boss’ and are _not_ marked with the TODO keyword ‘DONE’.  In
buffers with ‘org-odd-levels-only’ set, ‘LEVEL’ does not count the
number of stars, but ‘LEVEL=2’ corresponds to 3 stars etc.

   Here are more examples:

‘work+TODO​="WAITING"’
     Select ‘work’-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO keyword
     ‘WAITING’.

‘work+TODO​="WAITING"|home+TODO​="WAITING"’
     Waiting tasks both at work and at home.

   When matching properties, a number of different operators can be used
to test the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

     +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2
              +With={Sarah|Denny}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"

The type of comparison depends on how the comparison value is written:

   • If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison
     is done, and the allowed operators are ‘<’, ‘=’, ‘>’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’,
     and ‘<>’.

   • If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
     comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.

   • If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes _and_ angular
     brackets (like ‘DEADLINE<​="<2008-12-24 18:30>"’), both values are
     assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard Org way, and
     the comparison is done accordingly.  Valid values also include
     ‘"<now>"’ for now (including time), ‘"<today>"’, and ‘"<tomorrow>"’
     for these days at 0:00 hours, i.e., without a time specification.
     You can also use strings like ‘"<+5d>"’ or ‘"<-2m>"’ with units
     ‘d’, ‘w’, ‘m’, and ‘y’ for day, week, month, and year,
     respectively.

   • If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp match
     is performed, with ‘=’ meaning that the regexp matches the property
     value, and ‘<>’ meaning that it does not match.

   So the search string in the example finds entries tagged ‘work’ but
not ‘boss’, which also have a priority value ‘A’, a ‘Coffee’ property
with the value ‘unlimited’, an ‘EFFORT’ property that is numerically
smaller than 2, a ‘With’ property that is matched by the regular
expression ‘Sarah|Denny’, and that are scheduled on or after October 11,
2008.

   You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a
search, but beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See
*note Property Inheritance::, for details.

   For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also
a different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate
the tags/property part of the search string (which may include several
terms connected with ‘|’) with a ‘/’ and then specify a Boolean
expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is then similar to that
for tags, but should be applied with care: for example, a positive
selection on several TODO keywords cannot meaningfully be combined with
boolean AND.  However, _negative selection_ combined with AND can be
meaningful.  To make sure that only lines are checked that actually have
any TODO keyword (resulting in a speed-up), use ‘M-x org-agenda M’, or
equivalently start the TODO part after the slash with ‘!’.  Using ‘M-x
org-agenda M’ or ‘/!’ does not match TODO keywords in a DONE state.
Examples:

‘work/WAITING’
     Same as ‘work+TODO​="WAITING"’.

‘work/!-WAITING-NEXT’
     Select ‘work’-tagged TODO lines that are neither ‘WAITING’ nor
     ‘NEXT’.

‘work/!+WAITING|+NEXT’
     Select ‘work’-tagged TODO lines that are either ‘WAITING’ or
     ‘NEXT’.

10.3.4 Search view
------------------

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

‘M-x org-agenda s’ (‘org-search-view’)
     This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching a
     substring or specific words using a boolean logic.

   For example, the search string ‘computer equipment’ matches entries
that contain ‘computer equipment’ as a substring, even if the two words
are separated by more space or a line break.

   Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using
Boolean logic.  The search string ‘+computer +wifi -ethernet
-{8\.11[bg]}’ matches note entries that contain the keywords ‘computer’
and ‘wifi’, but not the keyword ‘ethernet’, and which are also not
matched by the regular expression ‘8\.11[bg]’, meaning to exclude both
‘8.11b’ and ‘8.11g’.  The first ‘+’ is necessary to turn on boolean
search, other ‘+’ characters are optional.  For more details, see the
docstring of the command ‘org-search-view’.

   You can incrementally adjust a boolean search with the following keys

‘[’     Add a positive search word
‘]’     Add a negative search word
‘{’     Add a positive regular expression
‘}’     Add a negative regular expression

   Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command also searches
the files listed in ‘org-agenda-text-search-extra-files’.


File: org,  Node: Stuck projects,  Prev: Search view,  Up: Built-in Agenda Views

10.3.5 Stuck projects
---------------------

If you are following a system like David Allen’s GTD to organize your
work, one of the “duties” you have is a regular review to make sure that
all projects move along.  A _stuck_ project is a project that has no
defined next actions, so it never shows up in the TODO lists Org mode
produces.  During the review, you need to identify such projects and
define next actions for them.

‘M-x org-agenda #’ (‘org-agenda-list-stuck-projects’)
     List projects that are stuck.

‘M-x org-agenda !’
     Customize the variable ‘org-stuck-projects’ to define what a stuck
     project is and how to find it.

   You almost certainly need to configure this view before it works for
you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are level-2
headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least one entry
marked with a TODO keyword ‘TODO’ or ‘NEXT’ or ‘NEXTACTION’.

   Let’s assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag ‘:PROJECT:’, and that you use a TODO keyword ‘MAYBE’
to indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let’s further
assume that the TODO keyword ‘DONE’ marks finished projects, and that
‘NEXT’ and ‘TODO’ indicate next actions.  The tag ‘:@shop:’ indicates
shopping and is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if
the project contains the special word ‘IGNORE’ anywhere, it should not
be listed either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible
projects with a tags/TODO match (see *note Tag Searches::)
‘+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE’, and then check for ‘TODO’, ‘NEXT’, ‘@shop’, and
‘IGNORE’ in the subtree to identify projects that are not stuck.  The
correct customization for this is:

     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@shop")
             "\\<IGNORE\\>"))

   Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of
this entry is searched for stuck projects.

10.4 Presentation and Sorting
=============================

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a _prefix_ that contains the _category_ (see *note
Categories::) of the item and other important information.  You can
customize in which column tags are displayed through
‘org-agenda-tags-column’.  You can also customize the prefix using the
option ‘org-agenda-prefix-format’.  This prefix is followed by a
cleaned-up version of the outline headline associated with the item.

* Menu:

* Categories::                   Not all tasks are equal.
* Time-of-day specifications::   How the agenda knows the time.
* Sorting of agenda items::      The order of things.
* Filtering/limiting agenda times:: Dynamically narrow the agenda.


File: org,  Node: Categories,  Next: Time-of-day specifications,  Up: Presentation and Sorting

10.4.1 Categories
-----------------

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this:

     #+CATEGORY: Thesis

   If you would like to have a special category for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a ‘CATEGORY’ property with the special
category you want to apply as the value.

   The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

   You can set up icons for category by customizing the
‘org-agenda-category-icon-alist’ variable.


File: org,  Node: Time-of-day specifications,  Next: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Categories,  Up: Presentation and Sorting

10.4.2 Time-of-day specifications
---------------------------------

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example

     <2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>

Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps:

     <2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>

   In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a
‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text(1).

   If the agenda integrates the Emacs diary (see *note Weekly/daily
agenda::), time specifications in diary entries are recognized as well.

   For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in the
previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

      8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
     12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
     19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
     20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

      8:00...... ------------------
      8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
     10:00...... ------------------
     12:00...... ------------------
     12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
     14:00...... ------------------
     16:00...... ------------------
     18:00...... ------------------
     19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
     20:00...... ------------------
     20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
‘org-agenda-use-time-grid’, and can be configured with
‘org-agenda-time-grid’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can, however, disable this by setting
‘org-agenda-search-headline-for-time’ variable to a ‘nil’ value.


File: org,  Node: Sorting of agenda items,  Next: Filtering/limiting agenda times,  Prev: Time-of-day specifications,  Up: Presentation and Sorting

10.4.3 Sorting of agenda items
------------------------------

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.

   • For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.
     The default order is to first collect all items containing an
     explicit time-of-day specification.  These entries are shown at the
     beginning of the list, as a _schedule_ for the day.  After that,
     items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
     ‘org-agenda-files’.  Within each category, items are sorted by
     priority (see *note Priorities::), which is composed of the base
     priority (2000 for priority ‘A’, 1000 for ‘B’, and 0 for ‘C’), plus
     additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

   • For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
     within each category, sorting takes place according to priority
     (see *note Priorities::).  The priority used for sorting derives
     from the priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an
     item is to its due or scheduled date.

   • For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
     the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.

   Sorting can be customized using the variable
‘org-agenda-sorting-strategy’, and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (see *note Effort Estimates::).


File: org,  Node: Filtering/limiting agenda times,  Prev: Sorting of agenda items,  Up: Presentation and Sorting

10.4.4 Filtering/limiting agenda times
--------------------------------------

Agenda built-in or customized commands are statically defined.  Agenda
filters and limits provide two ways of dynamically narrowing down the
list of agenda entries: _filters_ and _limits_.  Filters only act on the
display of the items, while limits take effect before the list of agenda
entries is built.  Filters are more often used interactively, while
limits are mostly useful when defined as local variables within custom
agenda commands.

Filtering in the agenda
.......................

‘/’ (‘org-agenda-filter-by-tag’)
     Filter the agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
     estimates.  The difference between this and a custom agenda command
     is that filtering is very fast, so that you can switch quickly
     between different filters without having to recreate the agenda.(1)

     You are prompted for a tag selection letter; ‘<SPC>’ means any tag
     at all.  Pressing ‘<TAB>’ at that prompt offers completion to
     select a tag, including any tags that do not have a selection
     character.  The command then hides all entries that do not contain
     or inherit this tag.  When called with prefix argument, remove the
     entries that _do_ have the tag.  A second ‘/’ at the prompt turns
     off the filter and shows any hidden entries.  Pressing ‘+’ or ‘-’
     switches between filtering and excluding the next tag.

     Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering.  If the
     variable ‘org-agenda-auto-exclude-function’ is set to a
     user-defined function, that function can decide which tags should
     be excluded from the agenda automatically.  Once this is set, the
     ‘/’ command then accepts ‘<RET>’ as a sub-option key and runs the
     auto exclusion logic.  For example, let’s say you use a ‘Net’ tag
     to identify tasks which need network access, an ‘Errand’ tag for
     errands in town, and a ‘Call’ tag for making phone calls.  You
     could auto-exclude these tags based on the availability of the
     Internet, and outside of business hours, with something like this:

          (defun org-my-auto-exclude-function (tag)
            (and (cond
                  ((string= tag "Net")
                   (/= 0 (call-process "/sbin/ping" nil nil nil
                                       "-c1" "-q" "-t1" "mail.gnu.org")))
                  ((or (string= tag "Errand") (string= tag "Call"))
                   (let ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time))))
                     (or (< hour 8) (> hour 21)))))
                 (concat "-" tag)))

          (setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'org-my-auto-exclude-function)

‘<’ (‘org-agenda-filter-by-category’)
     Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the
     item at point.  Pressing ‘<’ another time removes this filter.
     When called with a prefix argument exclude the category of the item
     at point from the agenda.

     You can add a filter preset in custom agenda commands through the
     option ‘org-agenda-category-filter-preset’.  See *note Setting
     options::.

‘^’ (‘org-agenda-filter-by-top-headline’)
     Filter the current agenda view and only display the siblings and
     the parent headline of the one at point.

‘=’ (‘org-agenda-filter-by-regexp’)
     Filter the agenda view by a regular expression: only show agenda
     entries matching the regular expression the user entered.  When
     called with a prefix argument, it filters _out_ entries matching
     the regexp.  Called in a regexp-filtered agenda view, remove the
     filter, unless there are two universal prefix arguments, in which
     case filters are cumulated.

     You can add a filter preset in custom agenda commands through the
     option ‘org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset’.  See *note Setting
     options::.

‘_’ (‘org-agenda-filter-by-effort’)
     Filter the agenda view with respect to effort estimates.  You first
     need to set up allowed efforts globally, for example

          (setq org-global-properties
                '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))

     You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one
     of ‘<’, ‘>’ and ‘=’, and then the one-digit index of an effort
     estimate in your array of allowed values, where ‘0’ means the 10th
     value.  The filter then restricts to entries with effort
     smaller-or-equal, equal, or larger-or-equal than the selected
     value.  For application of the operator, entries without a defined
     effort are treated according to the value of
     ‘org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high’.

     When called with a prefix argument, it removes entries matching the
     condition.  With two universal prefix arguments, it clears effort
     filters, which can be accumulated.

     You can add a filter preset in custom agenda commands through the
     option ‘org-agenda-effort-filter-preset’.  See *note Setting
     options::.

‘|’ (‘org-agenda-filter-remove-all’)
     Remove all filters in the current agenda view.

Setting limits for the agenda
.............................

Here is a list of options that you can set, either globally, or locally
in your custom agenda views (see *note Custom Agenda Views::).

‘org-agenda-max-entries’
     Limit the number of entries.

‘org-agenda-max-effort’
     Limit the duration of accumulated efforts (as minutes).

‘org-agenda-max-todos’
     Limit the number of entries with TODO keywords.

‘org-agenda-max-tags’
     Limit the number of tagged entries.

   When set to a positive integer, each option excludes entries from
other categories: for example, ‘(setq org-agenda-max-effort 100)’ limits
the agenda to 100 minutes of effort and exclude any entry that has no
effort property.  If you want to include entries with no effort
property, use a negative value for ‘org-agenda-max-effort’.  One useful
setup is to use ‘org-agenda-max-entries’ locally in a custom command.
For example, this custom command displays the next five entries with a
‘NEXT’ TODO keyword.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("n" todo "NEXT"
              ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)))))

   Once you mark one of these five entry as DONE, rebuilding the agenda
will again the next five entries again, including the first entry that
was excluded so far.

   You can also dynamically set temporary limits, which are lost when
rebuilding the agenda:

‘~’ (‘org-agenda-limit-interactively’)
     This prompts for the type of limit to apply and its value.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Custom commands can preset a filter by binding the variable
‘org-agenda-tag-filter-preset’ as an option.  This filter is then
applied to the view and persists as a basic filter through refreshes and
more secondary filtering.  The filter is a global property of the entire
agenda view—in a block agenda, you should only set this in the global
options section, not in the section of an individual block.

10.5 Commands in the Agenda Buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files “remotely” from the
agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

   Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, point needs to be in the desired line.

Motion
------

‘n’ (‘org-agenda-next-line’)
     Next line (same as ‘<DOWN>’ and ‘C-n’).

‘p’ (‘org-agenda-previous-line’)
     Previous line (same as ‘<UP>’ and ‘C-p’).

View/Go to Org file
-------------------

‘<SPC>’ or ‘mouse-3’ (‘org-agenda-show-and-scroll-up’)
     Display the original location of the item in another window.  With
     a prefix argument, make sure that drawers stay folded.

‘L’ (‘org-agenda-recenter’)
     Display original location and recenter that window.

‘<TAB>’ or ‘mouse-2’ (‘org-agenda-goto’)
     Go to the original location of the item in another window.

‘<RET>’ (‘org-agenda-switch-to’)
     Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.

‘F’ (‘org-agenda-follow-mode’)
     Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move point through the
     agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
     location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
     agenda buffers can be set with the variable
     ‘org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode’.

‘C-c C-x b’ (‘org-agenda-tree-to-indirect-buffer’)
     Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect
     buffer.  With a numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and
     then take that tree.  If N is negative, go up that many levels.
     With a ‘C-u’ prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect
     buffer.

‘C-c C-o’ (‘org-agenda-open-link’)
     Follow a link in the entry.  This offers a selection of any links
     in the text belonging to the referenced Org node.  If there is only
     one link, follow it without a selection prompt.

Change display
--------------

‘A’
     Interactively select another agenda view and append it to the
     current view.

‘o’
     Delete other windows.

‘v d’ or short ‘d’ (‘org-agenda-day-view’)
     Switch to day view.  When switching to day view, this setting
     becomes the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric
     prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific day of
     the year.  For example, ‘32 d’ jumps to February 1st.  When setting
     day view, a year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.
     For example, ‘200712 d’ jumps to January 12, 2007.  If such a year
     specification has only one or two digits, it is expanded into one
     of the 30 next years or the last 69 years.

‘v w’ or short ‘w’ (‘org-agenda-week-view’)
     Switch to week view.  When switching week view, this setting
     becomes the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric
     prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific day of
     the ISO week.  For example ‘9 w’ to ISO week number 9.  When
     setting week view, a year may be encoded in the prefix argument as
     well.  For example, ‘200712 w’ jumps to week 12 in 2007.  If such a
     year specification has only one or two digits, it is expanded into
     one of the 30 next years or the last 69 years.

‘v m’ (‘org-agenda-month-view’)
     Switch to month view.  Because month views are slow to create, they
     do not become the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A
     numeric prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific
     day of the month.  When setting month view, a year may be encoded
     in the prefix argument as well.  For example, ‘200712 m’ jumps to
     December, 2007.  If such a year specification has only one or two
     digits, it is expanded into one of the 30 next years or the last 69
     years.

‘v y’ (‘org-agenda-year-view’)
     Switch to year view.  Because year views are slow to create, they
     do not become the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A
     numeric prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific
     day of the year.

‘v <SPC>’ (‘org-agenda-reset-view’)
     Reset the current view to ‘org-agenda-span’.

‘f’ (‘org-agenda-later’)
     Go forward in time to display the span following the current one.
     For example, if the display covers a week, switch to the following
     week.  With a prefix argument, repeat that many times.

‘b’ (‘org-agenda-earlier’)
     Go backward in time to display earlier dates.

‘.’ (‘org-agenda-goto-today’)
     Go to today.

‘j’ (‘org-agenda-goto-date’)
     Prompt for a date and go there.

‘J’ (‘org-agenda-clock-goto’)
     Go to the currently clocked-in task _in the agenda buffer_.

‘D’ (‘org-agenda-toggle-diary’)
     Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See *note Weekly/daily
     agenda::.

‘v l’ or ‘v L’ or short ‘l’ (‘org-agenda-log-mode’)
     Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that were marked
     DONE while logging was on (see the variable ‘org-log-done’) are
     shown in the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that
     day.  You can configure the entry types that should be included in
     log mode using the variable ‘org-agenda-log-mode-items’.  When
     called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, show all possible logbook entries,
     including state changes.  When called with two prefix arguments
     ‘C-u C-u’, show only logging information, nothing else.  ‘v L’ is
     equivalent to ‘C-u v l’.

‘v [’ or short ‘[’ (‘org-agenda-manipulate-query-add’)
     Include inactive timestamps into the current view.  Only for
     weekly/daily agenda.

‘v a’ (‘org-agenda-archives-mode’)
     Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are archived
     (see *note Internal archiving::) are also scanned when producing
     the agenda.  To exit archives mode, press ‘v a’ again.

‘v A’
     Toggle Archives mode.  Include all archive files as well.

‘v R’ or short ‘R’ (‘org-agenda-clockreport-mode’)
     Toggle Clockreport mode.  In Clockreport mode, the daily/weekly
     agenda always shows a table with the clocked times for the time
     span and file scope covered by the current agenda view.  The
     initial setting for this mode in new agenda buffers can be set with
     the variable ‘org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode’.  By using a
     prefix argument when toggling this mode (i.e., ‘C-u R’), the clock
     table does not show contributions from entries that are hidden by
     agenda filtering(1).  See also the variable
     ‘org-clock-report-include-clocking-task’.

‘v c’
     Show overlapping clock entries, clocking gaps, and other clocking
     problems in the current agenda range.  You can then visit clocking
     lines and fix them manually.  See the variable
     ‘org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks’ for information on how to
     customize the definition of what constituted a clocking problem.
     To return to normal agenda display, press ‘l’ to exit Logbook mode.

‘v E’ or short ‘E’ (‘org-agenda-entry-text-mode’)
     Toggle entry text mode.  In entry text mode, a number of lines from
     the Org outline node referenced by an agenda line are displayed
     below the line.  The maximum number of lines is given by the
     variable ‘org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines’.  Calling this command
     with a numeric prefix argument temporarily modifies that number to
     the prefix value.

‘G’ (‘org-agenda-toggle-time-grid’)
     Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables
     ‘org-agenda-use-time-grid’ and ‘org-agenda-time-grid’.

‘r’ (‘org-agenda-redo’)
‘g’
     Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes
     after modification of the timestamps of items with ‘S-<LEFT>’ and
     ‘S-<RIGHT>’.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
     argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific
     TODO keyword.

‘C-x C-s’ or short ‘s’ (‘org-save-all-org-buffers’)
     Save all Org buffers in the current Emacs session, and also the
     locations of IDs.

‘C-c C-x C-c’ (‘org-agenda-columns’)
     Invoke column view (see *note Column View::) in the agenda buffer.
     The column view format is taken from the entry at point, or, if
     there is no entry at point, from the first entry in the agenda
     view.  So whatever the format for that entry would be in the
     original buffer (taken from a property, from a ‘COLUMNS’ keyword,
     or from the default variable ‘org-columns-default-format’) is used
     in the agenda.

‘C-c C-x >’ (‘org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock’)
     Remove the restriction lock on the agenda, if it is currently
     restricted to a file or subtree (see *note Agenda Files::).

‘M-<UP>’ (‘org-agenda-drag-line-backward’)
     Drag the line at point backward one line.  With a numeric prefix
     argument, drag backward by that many lines.

     Moving agenda lines does not persist after an agenda refresh and
     does not modify the contributing Org files.

‘M-<DOWN>’ (‘org-agenda-drag-line-forward’)
     Drag the line at point forward one line.  With a numeric prefix
     argument, drag forward by that many lines.

Remote editing
--------------

‘0--9’
     Digit argument.

‘C-_’ (‘org-agenda-undo’)
     Undo a change due to a remote editing command.  The change is
     undone both in the agenda buffer and in the remote buffer.

‘t’ (‘org-agenda-todo’)
     Change the TODO state of the item, both in the agenda and in the
     original Org file.

‘C-S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-agenda-todo-nextset’)
     Switch to the next set of TODO keywords.

‘C-S-<LEFT>’, ‘org-agenda-todo-previousset’
     Switch to the previous set of TODO keywords.

‘C-k’ (‘org-agenda-kill’)
     Delete the current agenda item along with the entire subtree
     belonging to it in the original Org file.  If the text to be
     deleted remotely is longer than one line, the kill needs to be
     confirmed by the user.  See variable ‘org-agenda-confirm-kill’.

‘C-c C-w’ (‘org-agenda-refile’)
     Refile the entry at point.

‘C-c C-x C-a’ or short ‘a’ (‘org-agenda-archive-default-with-confirmation’)
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the entry at point using the
     default archiving command set in ‘org-archive-default-command’.
     When using the ‘a’ key, confirmation is required.

‘C-c C-x a’ (‘org-agenda-toggle-archive-tag’)
     Toggle the archive tag (see *note Internal archiving::) for the
     current headline.

‘C-c C-x A’ (‘org-agenda-archive-to-archive-sibling’)
     Move the subtree corresponding to the current entry to its _archive
     sibling_.

‘C-c C-x C-s’ or short ‘$’ (‘org-agenda-archive’)
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  This
     means the entry is moved to the configured archive location, most
     likely a different file.

‘T’ (‘org-agenda-show-tags’)
     Show all tags associated with the current item.  This is useful if
     you have turned off ‘org-agenda-show-inherited-tags’, but still
     want to see all tags of a headline occasionally.

‘:’ (‘org-agenda-set-tags’)
     Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region in
     the agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.

‘,’ (‘org-agenda-priority’)
     Set the priority for the current item.  Org mode prompts for the
     priority character.  If you reply with ‘<SPC>’, the priority cookie
     is removed from the entry.

‘P’ (‘org-agenda-show-priority’)
     Display weighted priority of current item.

‘+’ or ‘S-<UP>’ (‘org-agenda-priority-up’)
     Increase the priority of the current item.  The priority is changed
     in the original buffer, but the agenda is not resorted.  Use the
     ‘r’ key for this.

‘-’ or ‘S-<DOWN>’ (‘org-agenda-priority-down’)
     Decrease the priority of the current item.

‘C-c C-z’ or short ‘z’ (‘org-agenda-add-note’)
     Add a note to the entry.  This note is recorded, and then filed to
     the same location where state change notes are put.  Depending on
     ‘org-log-into-drawer’, this may be inside a drawer.

‘C-c C-a’ (‘org-attach’)
     Dispatcher for all command related to attachments.

‘C-c C-s’ (‘org-agenda-schedule’)
     Schedule this item.  With a prefix argument, remove the scheduling
     timestamp

‘C-c C-d’ (‘org-agenda-deadline’)
     Set a deadline for this item.  With a prefix argument, remove the
     deadline.

‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-agenda-do-date-later’)
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the future.  If the date is in the past, the first call to
     this command moves it to today.  With a numeric prefix argument,
     change it by that many days.  For example, ‘3 6 5 S-<RIGHT>’
     changes it by a year.  With a ‘C-u’ prefix, change the time by one
     hour.  If you immediately repeat the command, it will continue to
     change hours even without the prefix argument.  With a double ‘C-u
     C-u’ prefix, do the same for changing minutes.  The stamp is
     changed in the original Org file, but the change is not directly
     reflected in the agenda buffer.  Use ‘r’ or ‘g’ to update the
     buffer.

‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-agenda-do-date-earlier’)
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the past.

‘>’ (‘org-agenda-date-prompt’)
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line.  The key ‘>’
     has been chosen, because it is the same as ‘S-.’ on my keyboard.

‘I’ (‘org-agenda-clock-in’)
     Start the clock on the current item.  If a clock is running
     already, it is stopped first.

‘O’ (‘org-agenda-clock-out’)
     Stop the previously started clock.

‘X’ (‘org-agenda-clock-cancel’)
     Cancel the currently running clock.

‘J’ (‘org-agenda-clock-goto’)
     Jump to the running clock in another window.

‘k’ (‘org-agenda-capture’)
     Like ‘org-capture’, but use the date at point as the default date
     for the capture template.  See ‘org-capture-use-agenda-date’ to
     make this the default behavior of ‘org-capture’.

Bulk remote editing selected entries
------------------------------------

‘m’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-mark’)

     Mark the entry at point for bulk action.  If there is an active
     region in the agenda, mark the entries in the region.  With numeric
     prefix argument, mark that many successive entries.

‘*’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-mark-all’)

     Mark all visible agenda entries for bulk action.

‘u’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-unmark’)

     Unmark entry for bulk action.

‘U’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-remove-all-marks’)

     Unmark all marked entries for bulk action.

‘M-m’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-toggle’)

     Toggle mark of the entry at point for bulk action.

‘M-*’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-toggle-all’)

     Mark entries matching a regular expression for bulk action.

‘%’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-mark-regexp’)

     Mark entries matching a regular expression for bulk action.

‘B’ (‘org-agenda-bulk-action’)

     Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This prompts
     for another key to select the action to be applied.  The prefix
     argument to ‘B’ is passed through to the ‘s’ and ‘d’ commands, to
     bulk-remove these special timestamps.  By default, marks are
     removed after the bulk.  If you want them to persist, set
     ‘org-agenda-bulk-persistent-marks’ to ‘t’ or hit ‘p’ at the prompt.

     ‘*’
          Toggle persistent marks.

     ‘$’
          Archive all selected entries.

     ‘A’
          Archive entries by moving them to their respective archive
          siblings.

     ‘t’
          Change TODO state.  This prompts for a single TODO keyword and
          changes the state of all selected entries, bypassing blocking
          and suppressing logging notes—but not timestamps.

     ‘+’
          Add a tag to all selected entries.

     ‘-’
          Remove a tag from all selected entries.

     ‘s’
          Schedule all items to a new date.  To shift existing schedule
          dates by a fixed number of days, use something starting with
          double plus at the prompt, for example ‘++8d’ or ‘++2w’.

     ‘d’
          Set deadline to a specific date.

     ‘r’
          Prompt for a single refile target and move all entries.  The
          entries are no longer in the agenda; refresh (‘g’) to bring
          them back.

     ‘S’
          Reschedule randomly into the coming N days.  N is prompted
          for.  With a prefix argument (‘C-u B S’), scatter only across
          weekdays.

     ‘f’
          Apply a function(2) to marked entries.  For example, the
          function below sets the ‘CATEGORY’ property of the entries to
          ‘web’.

               (defun set-category ()
                 (interactive "P")
                 (let ((marker (or (org-get-at-bol 'org-hd-marker)
                                   (org-agenda-error))))
                   (org-with-point-at marker
                     (org-back-to-heading t)
                     (org-set-property "CATEGORY" "web"))))

Calendar commands
-----------------

‘c’ (‘org-agenda-goto-calendar’)
     Open the Emacs calendar and go to the date at point in the agenda.

‘c’ (‘org-calendar-goto-agenda’)
     When in the calendar, compute and show the Org agenda for the date
     at point.

‘i’ (‘org-agenda-diary-entry’)

     Insert a new entry into the diary, using the date at point and (for
     block entries) the date at the mark.  This adds to the Emacs diary
     file(3), in a way similar to the ‘i’ command in the calendar.  The
     diary file pops up in another window, where you can add the entry.

     If you configure ‘org-agenda-diary-file’ to point to an Org file,
     Org creates entries in that file instead.  Most entries are stored
     in a date-based outline tree that will later make it easy to
     archive appointments from previous months/years.  The tree is built
     under an entry with a ‘DATE_TREE’ property, or else with years as
     top-level entries.  Emacs prompts you for the entry text—if you
     specify it, the entry is created in ‘org-agenda-diary-file’ without
     further interaction.  If you directly press ‘<RET>’ at the prompt
     without typing text, the target file is shown in another window for
     you to finish the entry there.  See also the ‘k r’ command.

‘M’ (‘org-agenda-phases-of-moon’)
     Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current
     date.

‘S’ (‘org-agenda-sunrise-sunset’)
     Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be
     set with calendar variables, see the documentation for the Emacs
     calendar.

‘C’ (‘org-agenda-convert-date’)
     Convert the date at point into many other cultural and historic
     calendars.

‘H’ (‘org-agenda-holidays’)
     Show holidays for three months around point date.

Quit and exit
-------------

‘q’ (‘org-agenda-quit’)

     Quit agenda, remove the agenda buffer.

‘x’ (‘org-agenda-exit’)

     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.  Buffers created by the
     user to visit Org files are not removed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Only tags filtering is respected here, effort filtering is
ignored.

‘org-agenda-bulk-custom-functions’.

File: org,  Node: Custom Agenda Views,  Next: Exporting Agenda Views,  Prev: Agenda Commands,  Up: Agenda Views

10.6 Custom Agenda Views
========================

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands are accessible through the
dispatcher (see *note Agenda Dispatcher::), just like the default
commands.

* Menu:

* Storing searches::             Type once, use often.
* Block agenda::                 All the stuff you need in a single buffer.
* Setting options::              Changing the rules.


File: org,  Node: Storing searches,  Next: Block agenda,  Up: Custom Agenda Views

10.6.1 Storing searches
-----------------------

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).

   Custom commands are configured in the variable
‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing ‘C’ from the agenda dispatcher (see *note Agenda
Dispatcher::).  You can also directly set it with Emacs Lisp in the
Emacs init file.  The following example contains all valid agenda views:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("x" agenda)
             ("y" agenda*)
             ("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
             ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
             ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
             ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ;description for "h" prefix
             ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
             ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
             ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))

The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command in order to access the command.  Usually
this will be just a single character, but if you have many similar
commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the first
character is the same in several combinations and serves as a prefix
key(1).  The second parameter is the search type, followed by the string
or regular expression to be used for the matching.  The example above
will therefore define:

‘x’
     as a global search for agenda entries planned(2) this week/day.

‘y’
     as the same search, but only for entries with an hour specification
     like ‘[h]h:mm’—think of them as appointments.

‘w’
     as a global search for TODO entries with ‘WAITING’ as the TODO
     keyword.

‘W’
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the results as a sparse tree.

‘u’
     as a global tags search for headlines tagged ‘boss’ but not
     ‘urgent’.

‘v’
     The same search, but limiting it to headlines that are also TODO
     items.

‘U’
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the result as a sparse tree.

‘f’
     to create a sparse tree (again, current buffer only) with all
     entries containing the word ‘FIXME’.

‘h’
     as a prefix command for a ‘HOME’ tags search where you have to
     press an additional key (‘l’, ‘p’ or ‘k’) to select a name (Lisa,
     Peter, or Kim) as additional tag to match.

   Note that ‘*-tree’ agenda views need to be called from an Org buffer
as they operate on the current buffer only.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.

   (2) _Planned_ means here that these entries have some planning
information attached to them, like a time-stamp, a scheduled or a
deadline string.  See ‘org-agenda-entry-types’ on how to set what
planning information is taken into account.


File: org,  Node: Block agenda,  Next: Setting options,  Prev: Storing searches,  Up: Custom Agenda Views

10.6.2 Block agenda
-------------------

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of _several_ commands, each of which creates a block in the
agenda buffer.  The available commands include ‘agenda’ for the daily or
weekly agenda (as created with ‘a’) , ‘alltodo’ for the global TODO list
(as constructed with ‘t’), and the matching commands discussed above:
‘todo’, ‘tags’, and ‘tags-todo’.  Here are two examples:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden")))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

This defines ‘h’ to create a multi-block view for stuff you need to
attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer contains your agenda for
the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag ‘home’, and also all
lines tagged with ‘garden’.  Finally the command ‘o’ provides a similar
view for office tasks.


File: org,  Node: Setting options,  Prev: Block agenda,  Up: Custom Agenda Views

10.6.3 Setting options for custom commands
------------------------------------------

Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING"
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
               (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent"
              ((org-show-context-detail 'minimal)))
             ("N" search ""
              ((org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
               (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))))

Now the ‘w’ command sorts the collected entries only by priority, and
the prefix format is modified to just say ‘Mixed:’ instead of giving the
category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of ‘U’ now turns out
ultra-compact, because neither the headline hierarchy above the match,
nor the headline following the match are shown.  The command ‘N’ does a
text search limited to only a single file.

   For command sets creating a block agenda,
‘org-agenda-custom-commands’ has two separate spots for setting options.
You can add options that should be valid for just a single command in
the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in the set.
The former are just added to the command entry; the latter must come
after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block agenda
example (see *note Block agenda::), let’s change the sorting strategy
for the ‘h’ commands to ‘priority-down’, but let’s sort the results for
‘garden’ tags query in the opposite order, ‘priority-up’.  This would
look like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"
                     ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

   As you see, the values and parentheses setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable—it fully
supports its structure.  Just one caveat: when setting options in this
interface, the _values_ are just Lisp expressions.  So if the value is a
string, you need to add the double-quotes around the value yourself.

   To control whether an agenda command should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize
‘org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts’.  Let’s say for example that you
have an agenda command ‘o’ displaying a view that you only need when
reading emails.  Then you would configure this option like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
           '(("o" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   You can also tell that the command key ‘o’ should refer to another
command key ‘r’.  In that case, add this command key like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
           '(("o" "r" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))

   See the docstring of the variable for more information.

10.7 Exporting Agenda Views
===========================

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML(1), Postscript, PDF(2),
and iCalendar files.  If you want to do this only occasionally, use the
following command:

‘C-x C-w’ (‘org-agenda-write’)

     Write the agenda view to a file.

   If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can
associate any custom agenda command with a list of output file names(3).
Here is an example that first defines custom commands for the agenda and
the global TODO list, together with a number of files to which to export
them.  Then we define two block agenda commands and specify file names
for them as well.  File names can be relative to the current working
directory, or absolute.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
             ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
             ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"))
              nil
              ("~/views/home.html"))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office"))
              nil
              ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))

   The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it
is ‘.html’, Org mode uses the htmlize package to convert the buffer to
HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is ‘.ps’,
‘ps-print-buffer-with-faces’ is used to produce Postscript output.  If
the extension is ‘.ics’, iCalendar export is run export over all files
that were used to construct the agenda, and limit the export to entries
listed in the agenda.  Any other extension produces a plain ASCII file.

   The export files are _not_ created when you use one of those commands
interactively because this might use too much overhead.  Instead, there
is a special command to produce _all_ specified files in one step:

‘e’ (‘org-store-agenda-views’)
     Export all agenda views that have export file names associated with
     them.

   You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda ""
              ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
               (ps-landscape-mode t)
               (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
               (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
               (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
              ("theagenda.ps"))))

This command sets two options for the Postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format—the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we do not want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
‘org-agenda-exporter-settings’ also apply, e.g.,

     (setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
           '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
             (ps-landscape-mode t)
             (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
             (htmlize-output-type 'css)))

but the settings in ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’ take precedence.

   From the command line you may also use:

     emacs -eval (org-batch-store-agenda-views) -kill

or, if you need to modify some parameters(4)

     emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
                   org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
                   org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
                   org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                   org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
           -kill

which creates the agenda views restricted to the file
‘~/org/project.org’, without diary entries and with a 30-day extent.

   You can also extract agenda information in a way that allows further
processing by other programs.  See *note Extracting Agenda
Information::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For HTML you need to install Hrvoje Niksic’s ‘htmlize.el’ from
Hrvoje Niksic’s repository (https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize).

File: org,  Node: Agenda Column View,  Prev: Exporting Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.8 Using Column View in the Agenda
====================================

Column view (see *note Column View::) is normally used to view and edit
properties embedded in the hierarchical structure of an Org file.  It
can be quite useful to use column view also from the agenda, where
entries are collected by certain criteria.

‘C-c C-x C-c’ (‘org-agenda-columns’)

     Turn on column view in the agenda.

   To understand how to use this properly, it is important to realize
that the entries in the agenda are no longer in their proper outline
environment.  This causes the following issues:

  1. Org needs to make a decision which columns format to use.  Since
     the entries in the agenda are collected from different files, and
     different files may have different columns formats, this is a
     non-trivial problem.  Org first checks if the variable
     ‘org-agenda-overriding-columns-format’ is currently set, and if so,
     takes the format from there.  Otherwise it takes the format
     associated with the first item in the agenda, or, if that item does
     not have a specific format (defined in a property, or in its file),
     it uses ‘org-columns-default-format’.

  2. If any of the columns has a summary type defined (see *note Column
     attributes::), turning on column view in the agenda visits all
     relevant agenda files and make sure that the computations of this
     property are up to date.  This is also true for the special
     ‘CLOCKSUM’ property.  Org then sums the values displayed in the
     agenda.  In the daily/weekly agenda, the sums cover a single day;
     in all other views they cover the entire block.

     It is important to realize that the agenda may show the same entry
     _twice_—for example as scheduled and as a deadline—and it may show
     two entries from the same hierarchy (for example a _parent_ and its
     _child_).  In these cases, the summation in the agenda leads to
     incorrect results because some values count double.

  3. When the column view in the agenda shows the ‘CLOCKSUM’ property,
     that is always the entire clocked time for this item.  So even in
     the daily/weekly agenda, the clocksum listed in column view may
     originate from times outside the current view.  This has the
     advantage that you can compare these values with a column listing
     the planned total effort for a task—one of the major applications
     for column view in the agenda.  If you want information about
     clocked time in the displayed period use clock table mode (press
     ‘R’ in the agenda).

  4. When the column view in the agenda shows the ‘CLOCKSUM_T’ property,
     that is always today’s clocked time for this item.  So even in the
     weekly agenda, the clocksum listed in column view only originates
     from today.  This lets you compare the time you spent on a task for
     today, with the time already spent—via ‘CLOCKSUM’—and with the
     planned total effort for it.

11 Markup for Rich Contents
***************************

Org is primarily about organizing and searching through your plain-text
notes.  However, it also provides a lightweight yet robust markup
language for rich text formatting and more.  For instance, you may want
to center or emphasize text.  Or you may need to insert a formula or
image in your writing.  Org offers syntax for all of this and more.
Used in conjunction with the export framework (see *note Exporting::),
you can author beautiful documents in Org—like the fine manual you are
currently reading.

* Menu:

* Paragraphs::                   The basic unit of text.
* Emphasis and Monospace::       Bold, italic, etc.
* Subscripts and Superscripts::  Simple syntax for raising/lowering text.
* Special Symbols::              Greek letters and other symbols.
* Embedded LaTeX::            LaTeX can be freely used inside Org documents.
* Literal Examples::             Source code examples with special formatting.
* Images::                       Display an image.
* Captions::                     Describe tables, images...
* Horizontal Rules::             Make a line.


File: org,  Node: Paragraphs,  Next: Emphasis and Monospace,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.1 Paragraphs
===============

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use ‘\\’ at the end of a line.

   To preserve the line breaks, indentation and blank lines in a region,
but otherwise use normal formatting, you can use this construct, which
can also be used to format poetry.

     #+BEGIN_VERSE
      Great clouds overhead
      Tiny black birds rise and fall
      Snow covers Emacs

         ---AlexSchroeder
     #+END_VERSE

   When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin.  You can include quotations in Org documents like this:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Everything should be made as simple as possible,
     but not any simpler ---Albert Einstein
     #+END_QUOTE

   If you would like to center some text, do it like this:

     #+BEGIN_CENTER
     Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
     but not any simpler
     #+END_CENTER


File: org,  Node: Emphasis and Monospace,  Next: Subscripts and Superscripts,  Prev: Paragraphs,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.2 Emphasis and Monospace
===========================

You can make words ‘*bold*’, ‘/italic/’, ‘_underlined_’, ‘=verbatim=’
and ‘~code~’, and, if you must, ‘+strike-through+’.  Text in the code
and verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific syntax; it is
exported verbatim.

   To turn off fontification for marked up text, you can set
‘org-fontify-emphasized-text’ to ‘nil’.  To narrow down the list of
available markup syntax, you can customize ‘org-emphasis-alist’.


File: org,  Node: Subscripts and Superscripts,  Next: Special Symbols,  Prev: Emphasis and Monospace,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.3 Subscripts and Superscripts
================================

‘^’ and ‘_’ are used to indicate super- and subscripts.  To increase the
readability of ASCII text, it is not necessary, but OK, to surround
multi-character sub- and superscripts with curly braces.  For example

     The radius of the sun is R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m.  On the other hand,
     the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 x R_{sun}.

   If you write a text where the underscore is often used in a different
context, Org’s convention to always interpret these as subscripts can
get in your way.  Configure the variable ‘org-use-sub-superscripts’ to
change this convention.  For example, when setting this variable to
‘{}’, ‘a_b’ is not interpreted as a subscript, but ‘a_{b}’ is.

‘C-c C-x \’ (‘org-toggle-pretty-entities’)
     This command formats sub- and superscripts in a WYSIWYM way.


File: org,  Node: Special Symbols,  Next: Embedded LaTeX,  Prev: Subscripts and Superscripts,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.4 Special Symbols
====================

You can use LaTeX-like syntax to insert special symbols—named
entities—like ‘\alpha’ to indicate the Greek letter, or ‘\to’ to
indicate an arrow.  Completion for these symbols is available, just type
‘\’ and maybe a few letters, and press ‘M-<TAB>’ to see possible
completions.  If you need such a symbol inside a word, terminate it with
a pair of curly brackets.  For example

     Pro tip: Given a circle \Gamma of diameter d, the length of its
     circumference is \pi{}d.

   A large number of entities is provided, with names taken from both
HTML and LaTeX; you can comfortably browse the complete list from a
dedicated buffer using the command ‘org-entities-help’.  It is also
possible to provide your own special symbols in the variable
‘org-entities-user’.

   During export, these symbols are transformed into the native format
of the exporter back-end.  Strings like ‘\alpha’ are exported as
‘&alpha;’ in the HTML output, and as ‘\(\alpha\)’ in the LaTeX output.
Similarly, ‘\nbsp’ becomes ‘&nbsp;’ in HTML and ‘~’ in LaTeX.

   If you would like to see entities displayed as UTF-8 characters, use
the following command(1):

‘C-c C-x \’ (‘org-toggle-pretty-entities’)

     Toggle display of entities as UTF-8 characters.  This does not
     change the buffer content which remains plain ASCII, but it
     overlays the UTF-8 character for display purposes only.

   In addition to regular entities defined above, Org exports in a
special way(2) the following commonly used character combinations: ‘\-’
is treated as a shy hyphen, ‘--’ and ‘---’ are converted into dashes,
and ‘...’ becomes a compact set of dots.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can turn this on by default by setting the variable
‘org-pretty-entities’, or on a per-file base with the ‘STARTUP’ option
‘entitiespretty’.

   (2) This behavior can be disabled with ‘-’ export setting (see *note
Export Settings::).

11.5 Embedded LaTeX
===================

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.
Exceptions include scientific notes, which often require mathematical
symbols and the occasional formula.  LaTeX(1) is widely used to typeset
scientific documents.  Org mode supports embedding LaTeX code into its
files, because many academics are used to writing and reading LaTeX
source code, and because it can be readily processed to produce pretty
output for a number of export back-ends.

* Menu:

* LaTeX fragments::           Complex formulas made easy.
* Previewing LaTeX fragments:: What will this snippet look like?
* CDLaTeX mode::              Speed up entering of formulas.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) LaTeX is a macro system based on Donald E. Knuth’s TeX system.
Many of the features described here as “LaTeX” are really from TeX, but
for simplicity I am blurring this distinction.


File: org,  Node: LaTeX fragments,  Next: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.5.1 LaTeX fragments
----------------------

Org mode can contain LaTeX math fragments, and it supports ways to
process these for several export back-ends.  When exporting to LaTeX,
the code is left as it is.  When exporting to HTML, Org can use either
MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org) (see *note Math formatting in HTML
export::) or transcode the math into images (see *note Previewing LaTeX
fragments::).

   LaTeX fragments do not need any special marking at all.  The
following snippets are identified as LaTeX source code:

   • Environments of any kind(1).  The only requirement is that the
     ‘\begin’ statement appears on a new line, preceded by only
     whitespace.

   • Text within the usual LaTeX math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts
     with currency specifications, single ‘$’ characters are only
     recognized as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at most
     two line breaks, is directly attached to the ‘$’ characters with no
     whitespace in between, and if the closing ‘$’ is followed by
     whitespace, punctuation or a dash.  For the other delimiters, there
     is no such restriction, so when in doubt, use ‘\(...\)’ as inline
     math delimiters.

For example:

     \begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
     x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures
     \end{equation}                          % etc

     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

   LaTeX processing can be configured with the variable
‘org-export-with-latex’.  The default setting is ‘t’ which means MathJax
for HTML, and no processing for ASCII and LaTeX back-ends.  You can also
set this variable on a per-file basis using one of these lines:

‘#+OPTIONS: tex:t’          Do the right thing automatically (MathJax)
‘#+OPTIONS: tex:nil’        Do not process LaTeX fragments at all
‘#+OPTIONS: tex:verbatim’   Verbatim export, for jsMath or so

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When MathJax is used, only the environments recognized by MathJax
are processed.  When dvipng, dvisvgm, or ImageMagick suite is used to
create images, any LaTeX environment is handled.


File: org,  Node: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Next: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.5.2 Previewing LaTeX fragments
---------------------------------

If you have a working LaTeX installation and ‘dvipng’, ‘dvisvgm’ or
‘convert’ installed(1), LaTeX fragments can be processed to produce
images of the typeset expressions to be used for inclusion while
exporting to HTML (see *note LaTeX fragments::), or for inline
previewing within Org mode.

   You can customize the variables ‘org-format-latex-options’ and
‘org-format-latex-header’ to influence some aspects of the preview.  In
particular, the ‘:scale’ (and for HTML export, ‘:html-scale’) property
of the former can be used to adjust the size of the preview images.

‘C-c C-x C-l’ (‘org-toggle-latex-fragment’)

     Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
     it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point, process
     all fragments in the current entry (between two headlines).  When
     called with a prefix argument, process the entire subtree.  When
     called with two prefix arguments, or when point is before the first
     headline, process the entire buffer.

   You can turn on the previewing of all LaTeX fragments in a file with

     #+STARTUP: latexpreview

   To disable it, simply use

     #+STARTUP: nolatexpreview

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) These are respectively available at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/>, <http://dvisvgm.bplaced.net/>
and from the ImageMagick suite.  Choose the converter by setting the
variable ‘org-preview-latex-default-process’ accordingly.


File: org,  Node: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: Previewing LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.5.3 Using CDLaTeX to enter math
----------------------------------

CDLaTeX mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major LaTeX mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org mode, you can make use of
some of the features of CDLaTeX mode.  You need to install ‘cdlatex.el’
and ‘texmathp.el’ (the latter comes also with AUCTeX) from
<http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex>.  Do not use CDLaTeX
mode itself under Org mode, but use the light version ‘org-cdlatex-mode’
that comes as part of Org mode.  Turn it on for the current buffer with
‘M-x org-cdlatex-mode’, or for all Org files with

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)

   When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for
more details see the documentation of CDLaTeX mode):

‘C-c {’

     Insert an environment template.

‘<TAB>’

     The ‘<TAB>’ key expands the template if point is inside a LaTeX
     fragment(1).  For example, ‘<TAB>’ expands ‘fr’ to ‘\frac{}{}’ and
     position point correctly inside the first brace.  Another ‘<TAB>’
     gets you into the second brace.

     Even outside fragments, ‘<TAB>’ expands environment abbreviations
     at the beginning of a line.  For example, if you write ‘equ’ at the
     beginning of a line and press ‘<TAB>’, this abbreviation is
     expanded to an ‘equation’ environment.  To get a list of all
     abbreviations, type ‘M-x cdlatex-command-help’.

‘^’
‘_’

     Pressing ‘_’ and ‘^’ inside a LaTeX fragment inserts these
     characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use ‘<TAB>’ to
     move out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single
     character or macro, they are removed again (depending on the
     variable ‘cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts’).

‘`’

     Pressing the backquote followed by a character inserts math macros,
     also outside LaTeX fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5 seconds
     after the backquote, a help window pops up.

‘'’

     Pressing the single-quote followed by another character modifies
     the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you wait more
     than 1.5 seconds after the single-quote, a help window pops up.
     Character modification works only inside LaTeX fragments; outside
     the quote is normal.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode has a method to test if point is inside such a fragment,
see the documentation of the function ‘org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p’.


File: org,  Node: Literal Examples,  Next: Images,  Prev: Embedded LaTeX,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.6 Literal Examples
=====================

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to markup.
Such examples are typeset in monospace, so this is well suited for
source code and similar examples.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       Some example from a text file.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that such blocks may be _indented_ in order to align nicely with
indented text and in particular with plain list structure (see *note
Plain Lists::).  For simplicity when using small examples, you can also
start the example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may
also be additional whitespace before the colon:

     Here is an example
        : Some example from a text file.

   If the example is source code from a programming language, or any
other text that can be marked up by Font Lock in Emacs, you can ask for
the example to look like the fontified Emacs buffer(1).  This is done
with the code block, where you also need to specify the name of the
major mode that should be used to fontify the example(2), see *note
Structure Templates:: for shortcuts to easily insert code blocks.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun org-xor (a b)
         "Exclusive or."
         (if a (not b) b))
      #+END_SRC

   Both in ‘example’ and in ‘src’ snippets, you can add a ‘-n’ switch to
the end of the ‘#+BEGIN’ line, to get the lines of the example numbered.
The ‘-n’ takes an optional numeric argument specifying the starting line
number of the block.  If you use a ‘+n’ switch, the numbering from the
previous numbered snippet is continued in the current one.  The ‘+n’
switch can also take a numeric argument.  This adds the value of the
argument to the last line of the previous block to determine the
starting line number.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n 20
       ;; This exports with line number 20.
       (message "This is line 21")
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp +n 10
       ;; This is listed as line 31.
       (message "This is line 32")
     #+END_SRC

   In literal examples, Org interprets strings like ‘(ref:name)’ as
labels, and use them as targets for special hyperlinks like
‘[[(name)]]’—i.e., the reference name enclosed in single parenthesis.
In HTML, hovering the mouse over such a link remote-highlights the
corresponding code line, which is kind of cool.

   You can also add a ‘-r’ switch which _removes_ the labels from the
source code(3).  With the ‘-n’ switch, links to these references are
labeled by the line numbers from the code listing.  Otherwise links use
the labels with no parentheses.  Here is an example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
       (save-excursion                 (ref:sc)
          (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump)
     #+END_SRC
     In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
     jumps to point-min.

   Finally, you can use ‘-i’ to preserve the indentation of a specific
code block (see *note Editing Source Code::).

   If the syntax for the label format conflicts with the language
syntax, use a ‘-l’ switch to change the format, for example

     #+BEGIN_SRC pascal -n -r -l "((%s))"

See also the variable ‘org-coderef-label-format’.

   HTML export also allows examples to be published as text areas (see
*note Text areas in HTML export::).

   Because the ‘#+BEGIN’ ... ‘#+END’ patterns need to be added so often,
a shortcut is provided (see *note Structure Templates::).

‘C-c '’ (‘org-edit-special’)
     Edit the source code example at point in its native mode.  This
     works by switching to a temporary buffer with the source code.  You
     need to exit by pressing ‘C-c '’ again(4).  The edited version then
     replaces the old version in the Org buffer.  Fixed-width
     regions—where each line starts with a colon followed by a space—are
     edited using ‘artist-mode’(5) to allow creating ASCII drawings
     easily.  Using this command in an empty line creates a new
     fixed-width region.

   Calling ‘org-store-link’ (see *note Handling Links::) while editing a
source code example in a temporary buffer created with ‘C-c '’ prompts
for a label.  Make sure that it is unique in the current buffer, and
insert it with the proper formatting like ‘(ref:label)’ at the end of
the current line.  Then the label is stored as a link ‘(label)’, for
retrieval with ‘C-c C-l’.

version 1.34 of the ‘htmlize.el’ package, which you need to install).
Fontified code chunks in LaTeX can be achieved using either the listings

while using line numbers for the links, which might be useful to explain
those in an Org mode example code.

   (4) Upon exit, lines starting with ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ and ‘,#+’ get a
comma prepended, to keep them from being interpreted by Org as outline

11.7 Images
===========

An image is a link to an image file(1) that does not have a description
part, for example

     ./img/cat.jpg

   If you wish to define a caption for the image (see *note Captions::)
and maybe a label for internal cross references (see *note Internal
Links::), make sure that the link is on a line by itself and precede it
with ‘CAPTION’ and ‘NAME’ keywords as follows:

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
     #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
     [[./img/a.jpg]]

Such images can be displayed within the buffer with the following
command:

‘C-c C-x C-v’ (‘org-toggle-inline-images’)
     Toggle the inline display of linked images.  When called with a
     prefix argument, also display images that do have a link
     description.  You can ask for inline images to be displayed at
     startup by configuring the variable
     ‘org-startup-with-inline-images’(2).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) What Emacs considers to be an image depends on
‘image-file-name-extensions’ and ‘image-file-name-regexps’.

   (2) The variable ‘org-startup-with-inline-images’ can be set within a
buffer with the ‘STARTUP’ options ‘inlineimages’ and ‘noinlineimages’.


File: org,  Node: Captions,  Next: Horizontal Rules,  Prev: Images,  Up: Markup for Rich Contents

11.8 Captions
=============

You can assign a caption to a specific part of a document by inserting a
‘CAPTION’ keyword immediately before it:

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
     | ... | ... |
     |-----+-----|

   Optionally, the caption can take the form:

     #+CAPTION[Short caption]: Longer caption.

   Even though images and tables are prominent examples of captioned
structures, the same caption mechanism can apply to many others—e.g.,
LaTeX equations, source code blocks.  Depending on the export back-end,
those may or may not be handled.

12 Exporting
************

At some point you might want to print your notes, publish them on the
web, or share them with people not using Org.  Org can convert and
export documents to a variety of other formats while retaining as much
structure (see *note Document Structure::) and markup (see *note Markup
for Rich Contents::) as possible.

   The libraries responsible for translating Org files to other formats
are called _back-ends_.  Org ships with support for the following
back-ends:

   • _ascii_ (ASCII format)
   • _beamer_ (LaTeX Beamer format)
   • _html_ (HTML format)
   • _icalendar_ (iCalendar format)
   • _latex_ (LaTeX format)
   • _md_ (Markdown format)
   • _odt_ (OpenDocument Text format)
   • _org_ (Org format)
   • _texinfo_ (Texinfo format)
   • _man_ (Man page format)

   Users can install libraries for additional formats from the Emacs
packaging system.  For easy discovery, these packages have a common
naming scheme: ‘ox-NAME’, where NAME is a format.  For example,
‘ox-koma-letter’ for _koma-letter_ back-end.  More libraries can be
found in the ‘contrib/’ directory (see *note Installation::).

   Org only loads back-ends for the following formats by default: ASCII,
HTML, iCalendar, LaTeX, and ODT.  Additional back-ends can be loaded in
either of two ways: by configuring the ‘org-export-backends’ variable,
or by requiring libraries in the Emacs init file.  For example, to load
the Markdown back-end, add this to your Emacs config:

     (require 'ox-md)

File: org,  Node: The Export Dispatcher,  Next: Export Settings,  Up: Exporting

12.1 The Export Dispatcher
==========================

The export dispatcher is the main interface for Org’s exports.  A
hierarchical menu presents the currently configured export formats.
Options are shown as easy toggle switches on the same screen.

   Org also has a minimal prompt interface for the export dispatcher.
When the variable ‘org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui’ is set to a
non-‘nil’ value, Org prompts in the minibuffer.  To switch back to the
hierarchical menu, press ‘?’.

‘C-c C-e’ (‘org-export’)

     Invokes the export dispatcher interface.  The options show default
     settings.  The ‘C-u’ prefix argument preserves options from the
     previous export, including any sub-tree selections.

   Org exports the entire buffer by default.  If the Org buffer has an
active region, then Org exports just that region.

   Within the dispatcher interface, the following key combinations can
further alter what is exported, and how.

‘C-a’

     Toggle asynchronous export.  Asynchronous export uses an external
     Emacs process with a specially configured initialization file to
     complete the exporting process in the background, without tying-up
     Emacs.  This is particularly useful when exporting long documents.

     Output from an asynchronous export is saved on the _export stack_.
     To view this stack, call the export dispatcher with a double ‘C-u’
     prefix argument.  If already in the export dispatcher menu, ‘&’
     displays the stack.

     You can make asynchronous export the default by setting
     ‘org-export-in-background’.

     You can set the initialization file used by the background process
     by setting ‘org-export-async-init-file’.

‘C-b’

     Toggle body-only export.  Useful for excluding headers and footers
     in the export.  Affects only those back-end formats that have
     sections like ‘<head>...</head>’ in HTML.

‘C-s’

     Toggle sub-tree export.  When turned on, Org exports only the
     sub-tree starting from point position at the time the export
     dispatcher was invoked.  Org uses the top heading of this sub-tree
     as the document’s title.  If point is not on a heading, Org uses
     the nearest enclosing header.  If point is in the document
     preamble, Org signals an error and aborts export.

     To make sub-tree export the default, customize the variable
     ‘org-export-initial-scope’.

‘C-v’

     Toggle visible-only export.  This is useful for exporting only
     certain parts of an Org document by adjusting the visibility of
     particular headings.


File: org,  Node: Export Settings,  Next: Table of Contents,  Prev: The Export Dispatcher,  Up: Exporting

12.2 Export Settings
====================

Export options can be set: globally with variables; for an individual
file by making variables buffer-local with in-buffer settings (see *note
In-buffer Settings::); by setting individual keywords or specifying them
in compact form with the ‘OPTIONS’ keyword; or for a tree by setting
properties (see *note Properties and Columns::).  Options set at a
specific level override options set at a more general level.

   In-buffer settings may appear anywhere in the file, either directly
or indirectly through a file included using ‘#+SETUPFILE: filename or
URL’ syntax.  Option keyword sets tailored to a particular back-end can
be inserted from the export dispatcher (see *note The Export
Dispatcher::) using the ‘Insert template’ command by pressing ‘#’.  To
insert keywords individually, a good way to make sure the keyword is
correct is to type ‘#+’ and then to use ‘M-<TAB>’(1) for completion.

   The export keywords available for every back-end, and their
equivalent global variables, include:

‘AUTHOR’
     The document author (‘user-full-name’).

‘CREATOR’
     Entity responsible for output generation
     (‘org-export-creator-string’).

‘DATE’
     A date or a time-stamp(2).

‘EMAIL’
     The email address (‘user-mail-address’).

‘LANGUAGE’
     Language to use for translating certain strings
     (‘org-export-default-language’).  With ‘#+LANGUAGE: fr’, for
     example, Org translates ‘Table of contents’ to the French ‘Table
     des matières’(3).

‘SELECT_TAGS’
     The default value is ‘("export")’.  When a tree is tagged with
     ‘export’ (‘org-export-select-tags’), Org selects that tree and its
     sub-trees for export.  Org excludes trees with ‘noexport’ tags, see
     below.  When selectively exporting files with ‘export’ tags set,
     Org does not export any text that appears before the first
     headline.

‘EXCLUDE_TAGS’
     The default value is ‘("noexport")’.  When a tree is tagged with
     ‘noexport’ (‘org-export-exclude-tags’), Org excludes that tree and
     its sub-trees from export.  Entries tagged with ‘noexport’ are
     unconditionally excluded from the export, even if they have an
     ‘export’ tag.  Even if a sub-tree is not exported, Org executes any
     code blocks contained there.

‘TITLE’
     Org displays this title.  For long titles, use multiple ‘#+TITLE’
     lines.

‘EXPORT_FILE_NAME’
     The name of the output file to be generated.  Otherwise, Org
     generates the file name based on the buffer name and the extension
     based on the back-end format.

   The ‘OPTIONS’ keyword is a compact form.  To configure multiple
options, use several ‘OPTIONS’ lines.  ‘OPTIONS’ recognizes the
following arguments.

‘'’
     Toggle smart quotes (‘org-export-with-smart-quotes’).  Depending on
     the language used, when activated, Org treats pairs of double
     quotes as primary quotes, pairs of single quotes as secondary
     quotes, and single quote marks as apostrophes.

‘*’
     Toggle emphasized text (‘org-export-with-emphasize’).

‘-’
     Toggle conversion of special strings
     (‘org-export-with-special-strings’).

‘:’
     Toggle fixed-width sections (‘org-export-with-fixed-width’).

‘<’
     Toggle inclusion of time/date active/inactive stamps
     (‘org-export-with-timestamps’).

‘\n’
     Toggles whether to preserve line breaks
     (‘org-export-preserve-breaks’).

‘^’
     Toggle TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If you write
     ‘^:{}’, ‘a_{b}’ is interpreted, but the simple ‘a_b’ is left as it
     is (‘org-export-with-sub-superscripts’).

‘arch’
     Configure how archived trees are exported.  When set to ‘headline’,
     the export process skips the contents and processes only the
     headlines (‘org-export-with-archived-trees’).

‘author’
     Toggle inclusion of author name into exported file
     (‘org-export-with-author’).

‘broken-links’
     Toggles if Org should continue exporting upon finding a broken
     internal link.  When set to ‘mark’, Org clearly marks the problem
     link in the output (‘org-export-with-broken-links’).

‘c’
     Toggle inclusion of CLOCK keywords (‘org-export-with-clocks’).

‘creator’
     Toggle inclusion of creator information in the exported file
     (‘org-export-with-creator’).

‘d’
     Toggles inclusion of drawers, or list of drawers to include, or
     list of drawers to exclude (‘org-export-with-drawers’).

‘date’
     Toggle inclusion of a date into exported file
     (‘org-export-with-date’).

‘e’
     Toggle inclusion of entities (‘org-export-with-entities’).

‘email’
     Toggle inclusion of the author’s e-mail into exported file
     (‘org-export-with-email’).

‘f’
     Toggle the inclusion of footnotes (‘org-export-with-footnotes’).

‘H’
     Set the number of headline levels for export
     (‘org-export-headline-levels’).  Below that level, headlines are
     treated differently.  In most back-ends, they become list items.

‘inline’
     Toggle inclusion of inlinetasks (‘org-export-with-inlinetasks’).

‘num’
     Toggle section-numbers (‘org-export-with-section-numbers’).  When
     set to number N, Org numbers only those headlines at level N or
     above.  Set ‘UNNUMBERED’ property to non-‘nil’ to disable numbering
     of heading and subheadings entirely.  Moreover, when the value is
     ‘notoc’ the headline, and all its children, do not appear in the
     table of contents either (see *note Table of Contents::).

‘p’
     Toggle export of planning information (‘org-export-with-planning’).
     “Planning information” comes from lines located right after the
     headline and contain any combination of these cookies: ‘SCHEDULED’,
     ‘DEADLINE’, or ‘CLOSED’.

‘pri’
     Toggle inclusion of priority cookies (‘org-export-with-priority’).

‘prop’
     Toggle inclusion of property drawers, or list the properties to
     include (‘org-export-with-properties’).

‘stat’
     Toggle inclusion of statistics cookies
     (‘org-export-with-statistics-cookies’).

‘tags’
     Toggle inclusion of tags, may also be ‘not-in-toc’
     (‘org-export-with-tags’).

‘tasks’
     Toggle inclusion of tasks (TODO items); or ‘nil’ to remove all
     tasks; or ‘todo’ to remove DONE tasks; or list the keywords to keep
     (‘org-export-with-tasks’).

‘tex’
     ‘nil’ does not export; ‘t’ exports; ‘verbatim’ keeps everything in
     verbatim (‘org-export-with-latex’).

‘timestamp’
     Toggle inclusion of the creation time in the exported file
     (‘org-export-time-stamp-file’).

‘title’
     Toggle inclusion of title (‘org-export-with-title’).

‘toc’
     Toggle inclusion of the table of contents, or set the level limit
     (‘org-export-with-toc’).

‘todo’
     Toggle inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
     (‘org-export-with-todo-keywords’).

‘|’
     Toggle inclusion of tables (‘org-export-with-tables’).

   When exporting sub-trees, special node properties can override the
above keywords.  These properties have an ‘EXPORT_’ prefix.  For
example, ‘DATE’ becomes, ‘EXPORT_DATE’ when used for a specific
sub-tree.  Except for ‘SETUPFILE’, all other keywords listed above have
an ‘EXPORT_’ equivalent.

   If ‘org-export-allow-bind-keywords’ is non-‘nil’, Emacs variables can
become buffer-local during export by using the ‘BIND’ keyword.  Its
syntax is ‘#+BIND: variable value’.  This is particularly useful for
in-buffer settings that cannot be changed using keywords.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Many desktops intercept ‘M-<TAB>’ to switch windows.  Use ‘C-M-i’
or ‘<ESC> <TAB>’ instead.

   (2) The variable ‘org-export-date-timestamp-format’ defines how this
timestamp are exported.

   (3) For export to LaTeX format—or LaTeX-related formats such as
Beamer—, the ‘org-latex-package-alist’ variable needs further
configuration.  See *note LaTeX specific export settings::.


File: org,  Node: Table of Contents,  Next: Include Files,  Prev: Export Settings,  Up: Exporting

12.3 Table of Contents
======================

The table of contents includes all headlines in the document.  Its depth
is therefore the same as the headline levels in the file.  If you need
to use a different depth, or turn it off entirely, set the
‘org-export-with-toc’ variable accordingly.  You can achieve the same on
a per file basis, using the following ‘toc’ item in ‘OPTIONS’ keyword:

     #+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only include two levels in TOC)
     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC at all)

   Org includes both numbered and unnumbered headlines in the table of
contents(1).  If you need to exclude an unnumbered headline, along with
all its children, set the ‘UNNUMBERED’ property to ‘notoc’ value.

     * Subtree not numbered, not in table of contents either
       :PROPERTIES:
       :UNNUMBERED: notoc
       :END:

   Org normally inserts the table of contents directly before the first
headline of the file.  To move the table of contents to a different
location, first turn off the default with ‘org-export-with-toc’ variable
or with ‘#+OPTIONS: toc:nil’.  Then insert ‘#+TOC: headlines N’ at the
desired location(s).

     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil
     ...
     #+TOC: headlines 2

   To adjust the table of contents depth for a specific section of the
Org document, append an additional ‘local’ parameter.  This parameter
becomes a relative depth for the current level.  The following example
inserts a local table of contents, with direct children only.

     * Section
     #+TOC: headlines 1 local

   Note that for this feature to work properly in LaTeX export, the Org
file requires the inclusion of the titletoc package.  Because of
compatibility issues, titletoc has to be loaded _before_ hyperref.
Customize the ‘org-latex-default-packages-alist’ variable.

   Use the ‘TOC’ keyword to generate list of tables—respectively, all
listings—with captions.

     #+TOC: listings
     #+TOC: tables

   Normally Org uses the headline for its entry in the table of
contents.  But with ‘ALT_TITLE’ property, a different entry can be
specified for the table of contents.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At the moment, some export back-ends do not obey this
specification.  For example, LaTeX export excludes every unnumbered
headline from the table of contents.


File: org,  Node: Include Files,  Next: Macro Replacement,  Prev: Table of Contents,  Up: Exporting

12.4 Include Files
==================

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For
example, to include your ‘.emacs’ file, you could use:

     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp

The first parameter is the file name to include.  The optional second
parameter specifies the block type: ‘example’, ‘export’ or ‘src’.  The
optional third parameter specifies the source code language to use for
formatting the contents.  This is relevant to both ‘export’ and ‘src’
block types.

   If an included file is specified as having a markup language, Org
neither checks for valid syntax nor changes the contents in any way.
For example and source blocks, Org code-escapes the contents before
inclusion.

   If an included file is not specified as having any markup language,
Org assumes it be in Org format and proceeds as usual with a few
exceptions.  Org makes the footnote labels (see *note Creating
Footnotes::) in the included file local to that file.  The contents of
the included file belong to the same structure—headline, item—containing
the ‘INCLUDE’ keyword.  In particular, headlines within the file become
children of the current section.  That behavior can be changed by
providing an additional keyword parameter, ‘:minlevel’.  It shifts the
headlines in the included file to become the lowest level.  For example,
this syntax makes the included file a sibling of the current top-level
headline:

     #+INCLUDE: "~/my-book/chapter2.org" :minlevel 1

   Inclusion of only portions of files are specified using ranges
parameter with ‘:lines’ keyword.  The line at the upper end of the range
will not be included.  The start and/or the end of the range may be
omitted to use the obvious defaults.

‘#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"’   Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded
‘#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"’    Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded
‘#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "10-"’    Include lines from 10 to EOF

   Inclusions may specify a file-link to extract an object matched by
‘org-link-search’(1) (see *note Search Options::).  The ranges for
‘:lines’ keyword are relative to the requested element.  Therefore,

     #+INCLUDE: "./paper.org::*conclusion" :lines 1-20

includes the first 20 lines of the headline named ‘conclusion’.

   To extract only the contents of the matched object, set
‘:only-contents’ property to non-‘nil’.  This omits any planning lines
or property drawers.  For example, to include the body of the heading
with the custom ID ‘theory’, you can use

     #+INCLUDE: "./paper.org::#theory" :only-contents t

   The following command allows navigating back and forth to the
included document:

‘C-c '’ (‘org-edit~special’)

     Visit the included file at point.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that ‘org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline’ is locally
bound to non-‘nil’.  Therefore, ‘org-link-search’ only matches headlines
and named elements.


File: org,  Node: Macro Replacement,  Next: Comment Lines,  Prev: Include Files,  Up: Exporting

12.5 Macro Replacement
======================

Macros replace text snippets during export.  Macros are defined globally
in ‘org-export-global-macros’, or document-wise with the following
syntax:

     #+MACRO: name   replacement text; $1, $2 are arguments

which can be referenced using ‘{{{name(arg1, arg2)}}}’(1).  For example

     #+MACRO: poem The rose is $1, The violet's $2. Life's ordered: Org assists you.
     {{{poem(red,blue)}}}

becomes

     The rose is red, The violet's blue. Life's ordered: Org assists you.

   As a special case, Org parses any replacement text starting with
‘(eval’ as an Emacs Lisp expression and evaluates it accordingly.
Within such templates, arguments become strings.  Thus, the following
macro

     #+MACRO: gnucheck (eval (concat "GNU/" (capitalize $1)))

turns ‘{{{gnucheck(linux)}}}’ into ‘GNU/Linux’ during export.

   Org recognizes macro references in following Org markup areas:
paragraphs, headlines, verse blocks, tables cells and lists.  Org also
recognizes macro references in keywords, such as ‘CAPTION’, ‘TITLE’,
‘AUTHOR’, ‘DATE’, and for some back-end specific export options.

   Org comes with following pre-defined macros:

‘{{{keyword(NAME)}}}’
‘{{{title}}}’
‘{{{author}}}’
‘{{{email}}}’
     The ‘keyword’ macro collects all values from NAME keywords
     throughout the buffer, separated with white space.  ‘title’,
     ‘author’ and ‘email’ macros are shortcuts for, respectively,
     ‘{{{keyword(TITLE)}}}’, ‘{{{keyword(AUTHOR)}}}’ and
     ‘{{{keyword(EMAIL)}}}’.

‘{{{date}}}’
‘{{{date(FORMAT)}}}’
     This macro refers to the ‘DATE’ keyword.  FORMAT is an optional
     argument to the ‘date’ macro that is used only if ‘DATE’ is a
     single timestamp.  FORMAT should be a format string understood by
     ‘format-time-string’.

‘{{{time(FORMAT)}}}’
‘{{{modification-time(FORMAT, VC)}}}’
     These macros refer to the document’s date and time of export and
     date and time of modification.  FORMAT is a string understood by
     ‘format-time-string’.  If the second argument to the
     ‘modification-time’ macro is non-‘nil’, Org uses ‘vc.el’ to
     retrieve the document’s modification time from the version control
     system.  Otherwise Org reads the file attributes.

‘{{{input-file}}}’
     This macro refers to the filename of the exported file.

‘{{{property(PROPERTY-NAME)}}}’
‘{{{property(PROPERTY-NAME, SEARCH OPTION)}}}’
     This macro returns the value of property PROPERTY-NAME in the
     current entry.  If SEARCH-OPTION (see *note Search Options::)
     refers to a remote entry, use it instead.

‘{{{n}}}’
‘{{{n(NAME)}}}’
‘{{{n(NAME, ACTION)}}}’
     This macro implements custom counters by returning the number of
     times the macro has been expanded so far while exporting the
     buffer.  You can create more than one counter using different NAME
     values.  If ACTION is ‘-’, previous value of the counter is held,
     i.e., the specified counter is not incremented.  If the value is a
     number, the specified counter is set to that value.  If it is any
     other non-empty string, the specified counter is reset to 1.  You
     may leave NAME empty to reset the default counter.

   Moreover, inline source blocks (see *note Structure of Code Blocks::)
use the special ‘results’ macro to mark their output.  As such, you are
advised against re-defining it, unless you know what you are doing.

   The surrounding brackets can be made invisible by setting
‘org-hide-macro-markers’ to a non-‘nil’ value.

   Org expands macros at the very beginning of the export process.

   (1) Since commas separate the arguments, commas within arguments have
to be escaped with the backslash character.  So only those backslash
characters before a comma need escaping with another backslash
character.

12.6 Comment Lines
==================

Lines starting with zero or more whitespace characters followed by one
‘#’ and a whitespace are treated as comments and, as such, are not
exported.

   Likewise, regions surrounded by ‘#+BEGIN_COMMENT’ ... ‘#+END_COMMENT’
are not exported.

   Finally, a ‘COMMENT’ keyword at the beginning of an entry, but after
any other keyword or priority cookie, comments out the entire subtree.
In this case, the subtree is not exported and no code block within it is
executed either(1).  The command below helps changing the comment status
of a headline.

‘C-c ;’ (‘org-toggle-comment’)

     Toggle the ‘COMMENT’ keyword at the beginning of an entry.

12.7 ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export
===============================

ASCII export produces an output file containing only plain ASCII
characters.  This is the simplest and most direct text output.  It does
not contain any Org markup.  Latin-1 and UTF-8 export use additional
characters and symbols available in these encoding standards.  All three
of these export formats offer the most basic of text output for maximum
portability.

   On export, Org fills and justifies text according to the text width
set in ‘org-ascii-text-width’.

   Org exports links using a footnote-like style where the descriptive
part is in the text and the link is in a note before the next heading.
See the variable ‘org-ascii-links-to-notes’ for details.

ASCII export commands
---------------------

‘C-c C-e t a’ (‘org-ascii-export-to-ascii’)
‘C-c C-e t l’
‘C-c C-e t u’

     Export as an ASCII file with a ‘.txt’ extension.  For ‘myfile.org’,
     Org exports to ‘myfile.txt’, overwriting without warning.  For
     ‘myfile.txt’, Org exports to ‘myfile.txt.txt’ in order to prevent
     data loss.

‘C-c C-e t A’ (‘org-ascii-export-to-ascii’)
‘C-c C-e t L’
‘C-c C-e t U’

     Export to a temporary buffer.  Does not create a file.

ASCII specific export settings
------------------------------

The ASCII export back-end has one extra keyword for customizing ASCII
output.  Setting this keyword works similar to the general options (see
*note Export Settings::).

‘SUBTITLE’
     The document subtitle.  For long subtitles, use multiple
     ‘#+SUBTITLE’ lines in the Org file.  Org prints them on one
     continuous line, wrapping into multiple lines if necessary.

Header and sectioning structure
-------------------------------

Org converts the first three outline levels into headlines for ASCII
export.  The remaining levels are turned into lists.  To change this
cut-off point where levels become lists, see *note Export Settings::.

Quoting ASCII text
------------------

To insert text within the Org file by the ASCII back-end, use one the
following constructs, inline, keyword, or export block:

     Inline text @@ascii:and additional text@@ within a paragraph.

     #+ASCII: Some text

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT ascii
     Org exports text in this block only when using ASCII back-end.
     #+END_EXPORT

ASCII specific attributes
-------------------------

ASCII back-end recognizes only one attribute, ‘:width’, which specifies
the width of a horizontal rule in number of characters.  The keyword and
syntax for specifying widths is:

     #+ATTR_ASCII: :width 10
     -----

ASCII special blocks
--------------------

Besides ‘#+BEGIN_CENTER’ blocks (see *note Paragraphs::), ASCII back-end
has these two left and right justification blocks:

     #+BEGIN_JUSTIFYLEFT
     It's just a jump to the left...
     #+END_JUSTIFYLEFT

     #+BEGIN_JUSTIFYRIGHT
     ...and then a step to the right.
     #+END_JUSTIFYRIGHT

12.8.2 Beamer specific export settings
--------------------------------------

Beamer export back-end has several additional keywords for customizing
Beamer output.  These keywords work similar to the general options
settings (see *note Export Settings::).

‘BEAMER_THEME’
     The Beamer layout theme (‘org-beamer-theme’).  Use square brackets
     for options.  For example:

          #+BEAMER_THEME: Rochester [height=20pt]

‘BEAMER_FONT_THEME’
     The Beamer font theme.

‘BEAMER_INNER_THEME’
     The Beamer inner theme.

‘BEAMER_OUTER_THEME’
     The Beamer outer theme.

‘BEAMER_HEADER’
     Arbitrary lines inserted in the preamble, just before the
     ‘hyperref’ settings.

‘DESCRIPTION’
     The document description.  For long descriptions, use multiple
     ‘DESCRIPTION’ keywords.  By default, ‘hyperref’ inserts
     ‘DESCRIPTION’ as metadata.  Use ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ to
     configure document metadata.  Use ‘org-latex-title-command’ to
     configure typesetting of description as part of front matter.

‘KEYWORDS’
     The keywords for defining the contents of the document.  Use
     multiple ‘KEYWORDS’ lines if necessary.  By default, ‘hyperref’
     inserts ‘KEYWORDS’ as metadata.  Use ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’
     to configure document metadata.  Use ‘org-latex-title-command’ to
     configure typesetting of keywords as part of front matter.

‘SUBTITLE’
     Document’s subtitle.  For typesetting, use
     ‘org-beamer-subtitle-format’ string.  Use
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ to configure document metadata.  Use
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ to configure typesetting of subtitle as
     part of front matter.


File: org,  Node: Frames and Blocks in Beamer,  Next: Beamer specific syntax,  Prev: Beamer specific export settings,  Up: Beamer Export

12.8.3 Frames and Blocks in Beamer
----------------------------------

Org transforms heading levels into Beamer’s sectioning elements, frames
and blocks.  Any Org tree with a not-too-deep-level nesting should in
principle be exportable as a Beamer presentation.

   • Org headlines become Beamer frames when the heading level in Org is
     equal to ‘org-beamer-frame-level’ or ‘H’ value in a ‘OPTIONS’ line
     (see *note Export Settings::).

     Org overrides headlines to frames conversion for the current tree
     of an Org file if it encounters the ‘BEAMER_ENV’ property set to
     ‘frame’ or ‘fullframe’.  Org ignores whatever
     ‘org-beamer-frame-level’ happens to be for that headline level in
     the Org tree.  In Beamer terminology, a full frame is a frame
     without its title.

   • Org exports a Beamer frame’s objects as block environments.  Org
     can enforce wrapping in special block types when ‘BEAMER_ENV’
     property is set(1).  For valid values see
     ‘org-beamer-environments-default’.  To add more values, see
     ‘org-beamer-environments-extra’.

   • If ‘BEAMER_ENV’ is set to ‘appendix’, Org exports the entry as an
     appendix.  When set to ‘note’, Org exports the entry as a note
     within the frame or between frames, depending on the entry’s
     heading level.  When set to ‘noteNH’, Org exports the entry as a
     note without its title.  When set to ‘againframe’, Org exports the
     entry with ‘\againframe’ command, which makes setting the
     ‘BEAMER_REF’ property mandatory because ‘\againframe’ needs frame
     to resume.

     When ‘ignoreheading’ is set, Org export ignores the entry’s
     headline but not its content.  This is useful for inserting content
     between frames.  It is also useful for properly closing a ‘column’
     environment.  @end itemize

     When ‘BEAMER_ACT’ is set for a headline, Org export translates that
     headline as an overlay or action specification.  When enclosed in
     square brackets, Org export makes the overlay specification a
     default.  Use ‘BEAMER_OPT’ to set any options applicable to the
     current Beamer frame or block.  The Beamer export back-end wraps
     with appropriate angular or square brackets.  It also adds the
     ‘fragile’ option for any code that may require a verbatim block.

     To create a column on the Beamer slide, use the ‘BEAMER_COL’
     property for its headline in the Org file.  Set the value of
     ‘BEAMER_COL’ to a decimal number representing the fraction of the
     total text width.  Beamer export uses this value to set the
     column’s width and fills the column with the contents of the Org
     entry.  If the Org entry has no specific environment defined,
     Beamer export ignores the heading.  If the Org entry has a defined
     environment, Beamer export uses the heading as title.  Behind the
     scenes, Beamer export automatically handles LaTeX column
     separations for contiguous headlines.  To manually adjust them for
     any unique configurations needs, use the ‘BEAMER_ENV’ property.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If ‘BEAMER_ENV’ is set, Org export adds ‘B_environment’ tag to
make it visible.  The tag serves as a visual aid and has no semantic
relevance.

12.8.4 Beamer specific syntax
-----------------------------

Since Org’s Beamer export back-end is an extension of the LaTeX
back-end, it recognizes other LaTeX specific syntax—for example,
‘#+LATEX:’ or ‘#+ATTR_LATEX:’.  See *note LaTeX Export::, for details.

   Beamer export wraps the table of contents generated with ‘toc:t’
‘OPTION’ keyword in a ‘frame’ environment.  Beamer export does not wrap
the table of contents generated with ‘TOC’ keyword (see *note Table of
Contents::).  Use square brackets for specifying options.

     #+TOC: headlines [currentsection]

   Insert Beamer-specific code using the following constructs:

     #+BEAMER: \pause

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT beamer
       Only Beamer export back-end exports this.
     #+END_BEAMER

     Text @@beamer:some code@@ within a paragraph.

   Inline constructs, such as the last one above, are useful for adding
overlay specifications to objects with ‘bold’, ‘item’, ‘link’,
‘radio-target’ and ‘target’ types.  Enclose the value in angular
brackets and place the specification at the beginning of the object as
shown in this example:

     A *@@beamer:<2->@@useful* feature

   Beamer export recognizes the ‘ATTR_BEAMER’ keyword with the following
attributes from Beamer configurations: ‘:environment’ for changing local
Beamer environment, ‘:overlay’ for specifying Beamer overlays in angular
or square brackets, and ‘:options’ for inserting optional arguments.

     #+ATTR_BEAMER: :environment nonindentlist
     - item 1, not indented
     - item 2, not indented
     - item 3, not indented

     #+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
     - item 1
     - item 2

     #+ATTR_BEAMER: :options [Lagrange]
     Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $H$ be
     a subgroup of $G$.  Then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

File: org,  Node: HTML specific export settings,  Next: HTML doctypes,  Prev: HTML export commands,  Up: HTML Export

12.9.2 HTML specific export settings
------------------------------------

HTML export has a number of keywords, similar to the general options
settings described in *note Export Settings::.

‘DESCRIPTION’
     This is the document’s description, which the HTML exporter inserts
     it as a HTML meta tag in the HTML file.  For long descriptions, use
     multiple ‘DESCRIPTION’ lines.  The exporter takes care of wrapping
     the lines properly.

‘HTML_DOCTYPE’
     Specify the document type, for example: HTML5 (‘org-html-doctype’).

‘HTML_CONTAINER’
     Specify the HTML container, such as ‘div’, for wrapping sections
     and elements (‘org-html-container-element’).

‘HTML_LINK_HOME’
     The URL for home link (‘org-html-link-home’).

‘HTML_LINK_UP’
     The URL for the up link of exported HTML pages
     (‘org-html-link-up’).

‘HTML_MATHJAX’
     Options for MathJax (‘org-html-mathjax-options’).  MathJax is used
     to typeset LaTeX math in HTML documents.  See *note Math formatting
     in HTML export::, for an example.

‘HTML_HEAD’
     Arbitrary lines for appending to the HTML document’s head
     (‘org-html-head’).

‘HTML_HEAD_EXTRA’
     More arbitrary lines for appending to the HTML document’s head
     (‘org-html-head-extra’).

‘KEYWORDS’
     Keywords to describe the document’s content.  HTML exporter inserts
     these keywords as HTML meta tags.  For long keywords, use multiple
     ‘KEYWORDS’ lines.

‘LATEX_HEADER’
     Arbitrary lines for appending to the preamble; HTML exporter
     appends when transcoding LaTeX fragments to images (see *note Math
     formatting in HTML export::).

‘SUBTITLE’
     The document’s subtitle.  HTML exporter formats subtitle if
     document type is ‘HTML5’ and the CSS has a ‘subtitle’ class.

   Some of these keywords are explained in more detail in the following
sections of the manual.


File: org,  Node: HTML doctypes,  Next: HTML preamble and postamble,  Prev: HTML specific export settings,  Up: HTML Export

12.9.3 HTML doctypes
--------------------

Org can export to various (X)HTML flavors.

   Set the ‘org-html-doctype’ variable for different (X)HTML variants.
Depending on the variant, the HTML exporter adjusts the syntax of HTML
conversion accordingly.  Org includes the following ready-made variants:

   • ‘"html4-strict"’
   • ‘"html4-transitional"’
   • ‘"html4-frameset"’
   • ‘"xhtml-strict"’
   • ‘"xhtml-transitional"’
   • ‘"xhtml-frameset"’
   • ‘"xhtml-11"’
   • ‘"html5"’
   • ‘"xhtml5"’

See the variable ‘org-html-doctype-alist’ for details.  The default is
‘"xhtml-strict"’.

   Org’s HTML exporter does not by default enable new block elements
introduced with the HTML5 standard.  To enable them, set
‘org-html-html5-fancy’ to non-‘nil’.  Or use an ‘OPTIONS’ line in the
file to set ‘html5-fancy’.

   HTML5 documents can now have arbitrary ‘#+BEGIN’ ... ‘#+END’ blocks.
For example:

     #+BEGIN_aside
       Lorem ipsum
     #+END_aside

exports to:

     <aside>
       <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
     </aside>

while this:

     #+ATTR_HTML: :controls controls :width 350
     #+BEGIN_video
     #+HTML: <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     #+HTML: <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
     #+END_video

exports to:

     <video controls="controls" width="350">
       <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
         <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
           <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
     </video>

   When special blocks do not have a corresponding HTML5 element, the
HTML exporter reverts to standard translation (see
‘org-html-html5-elements’).  For example, ‘#+BEGIN_lederhosen’ exports
to ‘<div class="lederhosen">’.

   Special blocks cannot have headlines.  For the HTML exporter to wrap
the headline and its contents in ‘<section>’ or ‘<article>’ tags, set
the ‘HTML_CONTAINER’ property for the headline.


File: org,  Node: HTML preamble and postamble,  Next: Quoting HTML tags,  Prev: HTML doctypes,  Up: HTML Export

12.9.4 HTML preamble and postamble
----------------------------------

The HTML exporter has delineations for preamble and postamble.  The
default value for ‘org-html-preamble’ is ‘t’, which makes the HTML
exporter insert the preamble.  See the variable
‘org-html-preamble-format’ for the format string.

   Set ‘org-html-preamble’ to a string to override the default format
string.  If the string is a function, the HTML exporter expects the
function to return a string upon execution.  The HTML exporter inserts
this string in the preamble.  The HTML exporter does not insert a
preamble if ‘org-html-preamble’ is set ‘nil’.

   The default value for ‘org-html-postamble’ is ‘auto’, which makes the
HTML exporter build a postamble from looking up author’s name, email
address, creator’s name, and date.  Set ‘org-html-postamble’ to ‘t’ to
insert the postamble in the format specified in the
‘org-html-postamble-format’ variable.  The HTML exporter does not insert
a postamble if ‘org-html-postamble’ is set to ‘nil’.


File: org,  Node: Quoting HTML tags,  Next: Links in HTML export,  Prev: HTML preamble and postamble,  Up: HTML Export

12.9.5 Quoting HTML tags
------------------------

The HTML export back-end transforms ‘<’ and ‘>’ to ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’.

   To include raw HTML code in the Org file so the HTML export back-end
can insert that HTML code in the output, use this inline syntax:
‘@@html:...@@’.  For example:

     @@html:<b>@@bold text@@html:</b>@@

   For larger raw HTML code blocks, use these HTML export code blocks:

     #+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
       All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_EXPORT


File: org,  Node: Links in HTML export,  Next: Tables in HTML export,  Prev: Quoting HTML tags,  Up: HTML Export

12.9.6 Links in HTML export
---------------------------

The HTML export back-end transforms Org’s internal links (see *note
Internal Links::) to equivalent HTML links in the output.  The back-end
similarly handles Org’s automatic links created by radio targets (see
*note Radio Targets::) similarly.  For Org links to external files, the
back-end transforms the links to _relative_ paths.

   For Org links to other ‘.org’ files, the back-end automatically
changes the file extension to ‘.html’ and makes file paths relative.  If
the ‘.org’ files have an equivalent ‘.html’ version at the same
location, then the converted links should work without any further
manual intervention.  However, to disable this automatic path
translation, set ‘org-html-link-org-files-as-html’ to ‘nil’.  When
disabled, the HTML export back-end substitutes the ID-based links in the
HTML output.  For more about linking files when publishing to a
directory, see *note Publishing links::.

   Org files can also have special directives to the HTML export
back-end.  For example, by using ‘#+ATTR_HTML’ lines to specify new
format attributes to ‘<a>’ or ‘<img>’ tags.  This example shows changing
the link’s title and style:

     #+ATTR_HTML: :title The Org mode homepage :style color:red;
     [[https://orgmode.org]]

12.9.7 Tables in HTML export
----------------------------

The HTML export back-end uses ‘org-html-table-default-attributes’ when
exporting Org tables to HTML.  By default, the exporter does not draw
frames and cell borders.  To change for this for a table, use the
following lines before the table in the Org file:

     #+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
     #+ATTR_HTML: border="2" rules="all" frame="border"

   The HTML export back-end preserves column groupings in Org tables
(see *note Column Groups::) when exporting to HTML.

   Additional options for customizing tables for HTML export.

‘org-html-table-align-individual-fields’
     Non-‘nil’ attaches style attributes for alignment to each table
     field.

‘org-html-table-caption-above’
     Non-‘nil’ places caption string at the beginning of the table.

‘org-html-table-data-tags’
     Opening and ending tags for table data fields.

‘org-html-table-default-attributes’
     Default attributes and values for table tags.

‘org-html-table-header-tags’
     Opening and ending tags for table’s header fields.

‘org-html-table-row-tags’
     Opening and ending tags for table rows.

‘org-html-table-use-header-tags-for-first-column’
     Non-‘nil’ formats column one in tables with header tags.

12.9.8 Images in HTML export
----------------------------

The HTML export back-end has features to convert Org image links to HTML
inline images and HTML clickable image links.

   When the link in the Org file has no description, the HTML export
back-end by default in-lines that image.  For example:
‘[[file:myimg.jpg]]’ is in-lined, while ‘[[file:myimg.jpg][the image]]’
links to the text, ‘the image’.  For more details, see the variable
‘org-html-inline-images’.

   On the other hand, if the description part of the Org link is itself
another link, such as ‘file:’ or ‘http:’ URL pointing to an image, the
HTML export back-end in-lines this image and links to the main image.
This Org syntax enables the back-end to link low-resolution thumbnail to
the high-resolution version of the image, as shown in this example:

     [[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]

   To change attributes of in-lined images, use ‘#+ATTR_HTML’ lines in
the Org file.  This example shows realignment to right, and adds ‘alt’
and ‘title’ attributes in support of text viewers and modern web
accessibility standards.

     #+CAPTION: A black cat stalking a spider
     #+ATTR_HTML: :alt cat/spider image :title Action! :align right
     [[./img/a.jpg]]

   The HTML export back-end copies the ‘http’ links from the Org file
as-is.

12.9.9 Math formatting in HTML export
-------------------------------------

LaTeX math snippets (see *note LaTeX fragments::) can be displayed in
two different ways on HTML pages.  The default is to use the MathJax
(http://www.mathjax.org), which should work out of the box with
Org(1)(2).  Some MathJax display options can be configured via
‘org-html-mathjax-options’, or in the buffer.  For example, with the
following settings,

     #+HTML_MATHJAX: align: left indent: 5em tagside: left font: Neo-Euler
     #+HTML_MATHJAX: cancel.js noErrors.js

equation labels are displayed on the left margin and equations are five
em from the left margin.  In addition, it loads the two MathJax
extensions ‘cancel.js’ and ‘noErrors.js’(3).

   See the docstring of ‘org-html-mathjax-options’ for all supported
variables.  The MathJax template can be configure via
‘org-html-mathjax-template’.

   If you prefer, you can also request that LaTeX fragments are
processed into small images that will be inserted into the browser page.
Before the availability of MathJax, this was the default method for Org
files.  This method requires that the dvipng program, dvisvgm or
ImageMagick suite is available on your system.  You can still get this
processing with

     #+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng

     #+OPTIONS: tex:dvisvgm

or

     #+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default Org loads MathJax from cdnjs.com (https://cdnjs.com)
as recommended by MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org).

   (2) Please note that exported formulas are part of an HTML document,
and that signs such as ‘<’, ‘>’, or ‘&’ have special meanings.  See
MathJax TeX and LaTeX support
(http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#tex-and-latex-in-html-documents).

12.9.10 Text areas in HTML export
---------------------------------

Before Org mode’s Babel, one popular approach to publishing code in HTML
was by using ‘:textarea’.  The advantage of this approach was that
copying and pasting was built into browsers with simple JavaScript
commands.  Even editing before pasting was made simple.

   The HTML export back-end can create such text areas.  It requires an
‘#+ATTR_HTML’ line as shown in the example below with the ‘:textarea’
option.  This must be followed by either an example or a source code
block.  Other Org block types do not honor the ‘:textarea’ option.

   By default, the HTML export back-end creates a text area 80
characters wide and height just enough to fit the content.  Override
these defaults with ‘:width’ and ‘:height’ options on the ‘#+ATTR_HTML’
line.

     #+ATTR_HTML: :textarea t :width 40
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (defun org-xor (a b)
          "Exclusive or."
          (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_EXAMPLE

12.9.11 CSS support
-------------------

You can modify the CSS style definitions for the exported file.  The
HTML exporter assigns the following special CSS classes(1) to
appropriate parts of the document—your style specifications may change
these, in addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines,
tables, etc.

‘p.author’             author information, including email
‘p.date’               publishing date
‘p.creator’            creator info, about org mode version
‘.title’               document title
‘.subtitle’            document subtitle
‘.todo’                TODO keywords, all not-done states
‘.done’                the DONE keywords, all states that count as done
‘.WAITING’             each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
‘.timestamp’           timestamp
‘.timestamp-kwd’       keyword associated with a timestamp, like ‘SCHEDULED’
‘.timestamp-wrapper’   span around keyword plus timestamp
‘.tag’                 tag in a headline
‘._HOME’               each tag uses itself as a class, “@” replaced by “_”
‘.target’              target for links
‘.linenr’              the line number in a code example
‘.code-highlighted’    for highlighting referenced code lines
‘div.outline-N’        div for outline level N (headline plus text)
‘div.outline-text-N’   extra div for text at outline level N
‘.section-number-N’    section number in headlines, different for each level
‘.figure-number’       label like “Figure 1:”
‘.table-number’        label like “Table 1:”
‘.listing-number’      label like “Listing 1:”
‘div.figure’           how to format an in-lined image
‘pre.src’              formatted source code
‘pre.example’          normal example
‘p.verse’              verse paragraph
‘div.footnotes’        footnote section headline
‘p.footnote’           footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
‘.footref’             a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
‘.footnum’             footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)
‘.org-svg’             default class for a linked ‘.svg’ image

   The HTML export back-end includes a compact default style in each
exported HTML file.  To override the default style with another style,
use these keywords in the Org file.  They will replace the global
defaults the HTML exporter uses.

     #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
     #+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" />

   To just turn off the default style, customize
‘org-html-head-include-default-style’ variable, or use this option line
in the Org file.

     #+OPTIONS: html-style:nil

   For longer style definitions, either use several ‘HTML_HEAD’ and
‘HTML_HEAD_EXTRA’ keywords, or use ‘<style> ... </style>’ blocks around
them.  Both of these approaches can avoid referring to an external file.

   In order to add styles to a sub-tree, use the ‘HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS’
property to assign a class to the tree.  In order to specify CSS styles
for a particular headline, you can use the ID specified in a ‘CUSTOM_ID’
property.

   Never change the ‘org-html-style-default’ constant.  Instead use
other simpler ways of customizing as described above.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the classes on TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts, use
the variables ‘org-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix’ and
‘org-html-tag-class-prefix’ to make them unique.

12.9.12 JavaScript supported display of web pages
-------------------------------------------------

Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to
enhance the web viewing experience of HTML files created with Org.  This
program enhances large files in two different ways of viewing.  One is
an _Info_-like mode where each section is displayed separately and
navigation can be done with the ‘n’ and ‘p’ keys, and some other keys as
well, press ‘?’ for an overview of the available keys.  The second one
has a _folding_ view, much like Org provides inside Emacs.  The script
is available at <https://orgmode.org/org-info.js> and the documentation
at <https://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/>.  The script is hosted
on <https://orgmode.org>, but for reliability, prefer installing it on
your own web server.

   To use this program, just add this line to the Org file:

     #+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil

The HTML header now has the code needed to automatically invoke the
script.  For setting options, use the syntax from the above line for
options described below:

‘path:’
     The path to the script.  The default is to grab the script from
     <https://orgmode.org/org-info.js>, but you might want to have a
     local copy and use a path like ‘../scripts/org-info.js’.

‘view:’
     Initial view when the website is first shown.  Possible values are:

     ‘info’       Info-like interface with one section per page
     ‘overview’   Folding interface, initially showing only top-level
     ‘content’    Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible
     ‘showall’    Folding interface, all headlines and text visible

‘sdepth:’
     Maximum headline level still considered as an independent section
     for info and folding modes.  The default is taken from
     ‘org-export-headline-levels’, i.e., the ‘H’ switch in ‘OPTIONS’.
     If this is smaller than in ‘org-export-headline-levels’, each
     info/folding section can still contain child headlines.

‘toc:’
     Should the table of contents _initially_ be visible?  Even when
     ‘nil’, you can always get to the “toc” with ‘i’.

‘tdepth:’
     The depth of the table of contents.  The defaults are taken from
     the variables ‘org-export-headline-levels’ and
     ‘org-export-with-toc’.

‘ftoc:’
     Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the “toc”?
     If yes, the toc is displayed as a section.

‘ltoc:’
     Should there be short contents (children) in each section?  Make
     this ‘above’ if the section should be above initial text.

‘mouse:’
     Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them.  Should be
     ‘underline’ (default) or a background color like ‘#cccccc’.

‘buttons:’
     Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere?  When ‘nil’ (the
     default), only one such button is present.

   You can choose default values for these options by customizing the
variable ‘org-infojs-options’.  If you always want to apply the script
to your pages, configure the variable ‘org-export-html-use-infojs’.

12.10 LaTeX Export
==================

The LaTeX export back-end can handle complex documents, incorporate
standard or custom LaTeX document classes, generate documents using
alternate LaTeX engines, and produce fully linked PDF files with
indexes, bibliographies, and tables of contents, destined for
interactive online viewing or high-quality print publication.

   While the details are covered in-depth in this section, here are some
quick references to variables for the impatient: for engines, see
‘org-latex-compiler’; for build sequences, see ‘org-latex-pdf-process’;
for packages, see ‘org-latex-default-packages-alist’ and
‘org-latex-packages-alist’.

   An important note about the LaTeX export back-end: it is sensitive to
blank lines in the Org document.  That’s because LaTeX itself depends on
blank lines to tell apart syntactical elements, such as paragraphs.

File: org,  Node: LaTeX/PDF export commands,  Next: LaTeX specific export settings,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.1 LaTeX/PDF export commands
---------------------------------

‘C-c C-e l l’ (‘org-latex-export-to-latex’)
     Export to a LaTeX file with a ‘.tex’ extension.  For ‘myfile.org’,
     Org exports to ‘myfile.tex’, overwriting without warning.

‘C-c C-e l L’ (‘org-latex-export-as-latex’)
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

‘C-c C-e l p’ (‘org-latex-export-to-pdf’)
     Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF file.

‘C-c C-e l o’
     Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF, then open the PDF using
     the default viewer.

‘M-x org-export-region-as-latex’
     Convert the region to LaTeX under the assumption that it was in Org
     mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be invoked
     in any buffer.

   The LaTeX export back-end can use any of these LaTeX engines:
‘pdflatex’, ‘xelatex’, and ‘lualatex’.  These engines compile LaTeX
files with different compilers, packages, and output options.  The LaTeX
export back-end finds the compiler version to use from
‘org-latex-compiler’ variable or the ‘#+LATEX_COMPILER’ keyword in the
Org file.  See the docstring for the ‘org-latex-default-packages-alist’
for loading packages with certain compilers.  Also see
‘org-latex-bibtex-compiler’ to set the bibliography compiler(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This does not allow setting different bibliography compilers for
different files.  However, “smart” LaTeX compilation systems, such as
latexmk, can select the correct bibliography compiler.

12.10.2 LaTeX specific export settings
--------------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end has several additional keywords for
customizing LaTeX output.  Setting these keywords works similar to the
general options (see *note Export Settings::).

‘DESCRIPTION’
     The document’s description.  The description along with author
     name, keywords, and related file metadata are inserted in the
     output file by the hyperref package.  See
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ for customizing metadata items.  See
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ for typesetting description into the
     document’s front matter.  Use multiple ‘DESCRIPTION’ keywords for
     long descriptions.

‘LANGUAGE’
     In order to be effective, the ‘babel’ or ‘polyglossia’
     packages—according to the LaTeX compiler used—must be loaded with
     the appropriate language as argument.  This can be accomplished by
     modifying the ‘org-latex-package-alist’ variable, e.g., with the
     following snippet:

          (add-to-list org-latex-package-alist
                       '("AUTO" "babel" t ("pdflatex")))
          (add-to-list org-latex-package-alist
                       '("AUTO" "polyglossia" t ("xelatex" "lualatex")))

‘LATEX_CLASS’
     This is LaTeX document class, such as _article_, _report_, _book_,
     and so on, which contain predefined preamble and headline level
     mapping that the LaTeX export back-end needs.  The back-end reads
     the default class name from the ‘org-latex-default-class’ variable.
     Org has _article_ as the default class.  A valid default class must
     be an element of ‘org-latex-classes’.

‘LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS’
     Options the LaTeX export back-end uses when calling the LaTeX
     document class.

‘LATEX_COMPILER’
     The compiler, such as ‘pdflatex’, ‘xelatex’, ‘lualatex’, for
     producing the PDF.  See ‘org-latex-compiler’.

‘LATEX_HEADER’
‘LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA’
     Arbitrary lines to add to the document’s preamble, before the
     hyperref settings.  See ‘org-latex-classes’ for adjusting the
     structure and order of the LaTeX headers.

‘KEYWORDS’
     The keywords for the document.  The description along with author
     name, keywords, and related file metadata are inserted in the
     output file by the hyperref package.  See
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ for customizing metadata items.  See
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ for typesetting description into the
     document’s front matter.  Use multiple ‘KEYWORDS’ lines if
     necessary.

‘SUBTITLE’
     The document’s subtitle.  It is typeset as per
     ‘org-latex-subtitle-format’.  If ‘org-latex-subtitle-separate’ is
     non-‘nil’, it is typed as part of the ‘\title’ macro.  See
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ for customizing metadata items.  See
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ for typesetting description into the
     document’s front matter.

   The following sections have further details.


File: org,  Node: LaTeX header and sectioning,  Next: Quoting LaTeX code,  Prev: LaTeX specific export settings,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.3 LaTeX header and sectioning structure
---------------------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end converts the first three of Org’s outline
levels into LaTeX headlines.  The remaining Org levels are exported as
lists.  To change this globally for the cut-off point between levels and
lists, (see *note Export Settings::).

   By default, the LaTeX export back-end uses the _article_ class.

   To change the default class globally, edit ‘org-latex-default-class’.
To change the default class locally in an Org file, add option lines
‘#+LATEX_CLASS: myclass’.  To change the default class for just a part
of the Org file, set a sub-tree property, ‘EXPORT_LATEX_CLASS’.  The
class name entered here must be valid member of ‘org-latex-classes’.
This variable defines a header template for each class into which the
exporter splices the values of ‘org-latex-default-packages-alist’ and
‘org-latex-packages-alist’.  Use the same three variables to define
custom sectioning or custom classes.

   The LaTeX export back-end sends the ‘LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS’ keyword and
‘EXPORT_LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS’ property as options to the LaTeX
‘\documentclass’ macro.  The options and the syntax for specifying them,
including enclosing them in square brackets, follow LaTeX conventions.

     #+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper,11pt,twoside,twocolumn]

   The LaTeX export back-end appends values from ‘LATEX_HEADER’ and
‘LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA’ keywords to the LaTeX header.  The docstring for
‘org-latex-classes’ explains in more detail.  Also note that LaTeX
export back-end does not append ‘LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA’ to the header when
previewing LaTeX snippets (see *note Previewing LaTeX fragments::).

   A sample Org file with the above headers:

     #+LATEX_CLASS: article
     #+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper]
     #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{xyz}

     * Headline 1
       some text
     * Headline 2
       some more text

12.10.4 Quoting LaTeX code
--------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end can insert any arbitrary LaTeX code, see *note
Embedded LaTeX::.  There are three ways to embed such code in the Org
file and they all use different quoting syntax.

   Inserting in-line quoted with @ symbols:

     Code embedded in-line @@latex:any arbitrary LaTeX code@@ in a paragraph.

   Inserting as one or more keyword lines in the Org file:

     #+LATEX: any arbitrary LaTeX code

   Inserting as an export block in the Org file, where the back-end
exports any code between begin and end markers:

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
       any arbitrary LaTeX code
     #+END_EXPORT


File: org,  Node: Tables in LaTeX export,  Next: Images in LaTeX export,  Prev: Quoting LaTeX code,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.5 Tables in LaTeX export
------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end can pass several LaTeX attributes for table
contents and layout.  Besides specifying a label (see *note Internal
Links::) and a caption (see *note Captions::), the other valid LaTeX
attributes include:

‘:mode’
     The LaTeX export back-end wraps the table differently depending on
     the mode for accurate rendering of math symbols.  Mode is either
     ‘table’, ‘math’, ‘inline-math’ or ‘verbatim’.

     For ‘math’ or ‘inline-math’ mode, LaTeX export back-end wraps the
     table in a math environment, but every cell in it is exported
     as-is.  The LaTeX export back-end determines the default mode from
     ‘org-latex-default-table-mode’.  The LaTeX export back-end merges
     contiguous tables in the same mode into a single environment.

‘:environment’
     Set the default LaTeX table environment for the LaTeX export
     back-end to use when exporting Org tables.  Common LaTeX table
     environments are provided by these packages: tabularx, longtable,
     array, tabu, and bmatrix.  For packages, such as tabularx and tabu,
     or any newer replacements, include them in the
     ‘org-latex-packages-alist’ variable so the LaTeX export back-end
     can insert the appropriate load package headers in the converted
     LaTeX file.  Look in the docstring for the
     ‘org-latex-packages-alist’ variable for configuring these packages
     for LaTeX snippet previews, if any.

‘:caption’
     Use ‘CAPTION’ keyword to set a simple caption for a table (see
     *note Captions::).  For custom captions, use ‘:caption’ attribute,
     which accepts raw LaTeX code.  ‘:caption’ value overrides ‘CAPTION’
     value.

‘:float’
‘:placement’
     The table environments by default are not floats in LaTeX.  To make
     them floating objects use ‘:float’ with one of the following
     options: ‘sideways’, ‘multicolumn’, ‘t’, and ‘nil’.

     LaTeX floats can also have additional layout ‘:placement’
     attributes.  These are the usual ‘[h t b p ! H]’ permissions
     specified in square brackets.  Note that for ‘:float sideways’
     tables, the LaTeX export back-end ignores ‘:placement’ attributes.

‘:align’
‘:font’
‘:width’
     The LaTeX export back-end uses these attributes for regular tables
     to set their alignments, fonts, and widths.

‘:spread’
     When ‘:spread’ is non-‘nil’, the LaTeX export back-end spreads or
     shrinks the table by the ‘:width’ for tabu and longtabu
     environments.  ‘:spread’ has no effect if ‘:width’ is not set.

‘:booktabs’
‘:center’
‘:rmlines’
     All three commands are toggles.  ‘:booktabs’ brings in modern
     typesetting enhancements to regular tables.  The booktabs package
     has to be loaded through ‘org-latex-packages-alist’.  ‘:center’ is
     for centering the table.  ‘:rmlines’ removes all but the very first
     horizontal line made of ASCII characters from “table.el” tables
     only.

‘:math-prefix’
‘:math-suffix’
‘:math-arguments’
     The LaTeX export back-end inserts ‘:math-prefix’ string value in a
     math environment before the table.  The LaTeX export back-end
     inserts ‘:math-suffix’ string value in a math environment after the
     table.  The LaTeX export back-end inserts ‘:math-arguments’ string
     value between the macro name and the table’s contents.
     ‘:math-arguments’ comes in use for matrix macros that require more
     than one argument, such as ‘qbordermatrix’.

   LaTeX table attributes help formatting tables for a wide range of
situations, such as matrix product or spanning multiple pages:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align l|lp{3cm}r|l
     | ... | ... |
     | ... | ... |

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix :math-suffix \times
     | a | b |
     | c | d |
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix
     | 1 | 2 |
     | 3 | 4 |

   Set the caption with the LaTeX command
‘\bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}’:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}
     | ... | ... |
     | ... | ... |

12.10.6 Images in LaTeX export
------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end processes image links in Org files that do not
have descriptions, such as these links ‘[[file:img.jpg]]’ or
‘[[./img.jpg]]’, as direct image insertions in the final PDF output.  In
the PDF, they are no longer links but actual images embedded on the
page.  The LaTeX export back-end uses ‘\includegraphics’ macro to insert
the image.  But for TikZ (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/>)
images, the back-end uses an ‘\input’ macro wrapped within a
‘tikzpicture’ environment.

   For specifying image ‘:width’, ‘:height’, and other ‘:options’, use
this syntax:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :options angle=90
     [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   For custom commands for captions, use the ‘:caption’ attribute.  It
overrides the default ‘#+CAPTION’ value:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}
     [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   When captions follow the method as described in *note Captions::, the
LaTeX export back-end wraps the picture in a floating ‘figure’
environment.  To float an image without specifying a caption, set the
‘:float’ attribute to one of the following:

‘t’
     For a standard ‘figure’ environment; used by default whenever an
     image has a caption.

‘multicolumn’
     To span the image across multiple columns of a page; the back-end
     wraps the image in a ‘figure*’ environment.

‘wrap’
     For text to flow around the image on the right; the figure occupies
     the left half of the page.

‘sideways’
     For a new page with the image sideways, rotated ninety degrees, in
     a ‘sidewaysfigure’ environment; overrides ‘:placement’ setting.

‘nil’
     To avoid a ‘:float’ even if using a caption.

   Use the ‘placement’ attribute to modify a floating environment’s
placement.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
     [[./img/hst.png]]

   The LaTeX export back-end centers all images by default.  Setting
‘:center’ to ‘nil’ disables centering.  To disable centering globally,
set ‘org-latex-images-centered’ to ‘t’.

   Set the ‘:comment-include’ attribute to non-‘nil’ value for the LaTeX
export back-end to comment out the ‘\includegraphics’ macro.

12.10.7 Plain lists in LaTeX export
-----------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end accepts the ‘environment’ and ‘options’
attributes for plain lists.  Both attributes work together for
customizing lists, as shown in the examples:

     #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[inline]{enumitem}
     Some ways to say "Hello":
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment itemize*
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [label={}, itemjoin={,}, itemjoin*={, and}]
     - Hola
     - Bonjour
     - Guten Tag.

   Since LaTeX supports only four levels of nesting for lists, use an
external package, such as ‘enumitem’ in LaTeX, for levels deeper than
four:

     #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{enumitem}
     #+LATEX_HEADER: \renewlist{itemize}{itemize}{9}
     #+LATEX_HEADER: \setlist[itemize]{label=$\circ$}
     - One
       - Two
         - Three
           - Four
             - Five


File: org,  Node: Source blocks in LaTeX export,  Next: Example blocks in LaTeX export,  Prev: Plain lists in LaTeX export,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.8 Source blocks in LaTeX export
-------------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end can make source code blocks into floating
objects through the attributes ‘:float’ and ‘:options’.  For ‘:float’:

‘t’
     Makes a source block float; by default floats any source block with
     a caption.

‘multicolumn’
     Spans the source block across multiple columns of a page.

‘nil’
     Avoids a ‘:float’ even if using a caption; useful for source code
     blocks that may not fit on a page.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       Lisp code that may not fit in a single page.
     #+END_SRC

   The LaTeX export back-end passes string values in ‘:options’ to LaTeX
packages for customization of that specific source block.  In the
example below, the ‘:options’ are set for Minted.  Minted is a source
code highlighting LaTeX package with many configurable options.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options commentstyle=\bfseries
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun Fib (n)
         (if (< n 2) n (+ (Fib (- n 1)) (Fib (- n 2)))))
     #+END_SRC

   To apply similar configuration options for all source blocks in a
file, use the ‘org-latex-listings-options’ and
‘org-latex-minted-options’ variables.


File: org,  Node: Example blocks in LaTeX export,  Next: Special blocks in LaTeX export,  Prev: Source blocks in LaTeX export,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.9 Example blocks in LaTeX export
--------------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end wraps the contents of example blocks in a
‘verbatim’ environment.  To change this behavior to use another
environment globally, specify an appropriate export filter (see *note
Advanced Export Configuration::).  To change this behavior to use
another environment for each block, use the ‘:environment’ parameter to
specify a custom environment.

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment myverbatim
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       This sentence is false.
     #+END_EXAMPLE


File: org,  Node: Special blocks in LaTeX export,  Next: Horizontal rules in LaTeX export,  Prev: Example blocks in LaTeX export,  Up: LaTeX Export

12.10.10 Special blocks in LaTeX export
---------------------------------------

For other special blocks in the Org file, the LaTeX export back-end
makes a special environment of the same name.  The back-end also takes
‘:options’, if any, and appends as-is to that environment’s opening
string.  For example:

     #+BEGIN_abstract
       We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     #+END_abstract

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof of important theorem]
     #+BEGIN_proof
       ...
       Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     #+END_proof

exports to

     \begin{abstract}
       We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     \end{abstract}

     \begin{proof}[Proof of important theorem]
       ...
       Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     \end{proof}

   If you need to insert a specific caption command, use ‘:caption’
attribute.  It overrides standard ‘CAPTION’ value, if any.  For example:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \MyCaption{HeadingA}
     #+BEGIN_proof
       ...
     #+END_proof

12.10.11 Horizontal rules in LaTeX export
-----------------------------------------

The LaTeX export back-end converts horizontal rules by the specified
‘:width’ and ‘:thickness’ attributes.  For example:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .6\textwidth :thickness 0.8pt

File: org,  Node: Markdown Export,  Next: OpenDocument Text Export,  Prev: LaTeX Export,  Up: Exporting

12.11 Markdown Export
=====================

The Markdown export back-end, “md”, converts an Org file to Markdown
format, as defined at <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>.

   Since it is built on top of the HTML back-end (see *note HTML
Export::), it converts every Org construct not defined in Markdown
syntax, such as tables, to HTML.

Markdown export commands
------------------------

‘C-c C-e m m’ (‘org-md-export-to-markdown’)
     Export to a text file with Markdown syntax.  For ‘myfile.org’, Org
     exports to ‘myfile.md’, overwritten without warning.

‘C-c C-e m M’ (‘org-md-export-as-markdown’)
     Export to a temporary buffer.  Does not create a file.

‘C-c C-e m o’
     Export as a text file with Markdown syntax, then open it.

Header and sectioning structure
-------------------------------

Based on ‘org-md-headline-style’, Markdown export can generate headlines
of both _atx_ and _setext_ types.  _atx_ limits headline levels to two
whereas _setext_ limits headline levels to six.  Beyond these limits,
the export back-end converts headlines to lists.  To set a limit to a
level before the absolute limit (see *note Export Settings::).

12.12.1 Pre-requisites for ODT export
-------------------------------------

The ODT export back-end relies on the zip program to create the final
compressed ODT output.  Check if ‘zip’ is locally available and
executable.  Without it, export cannot finish.


File: org,  Node: ODT export commands,  Next: ODT specific export settings,  Prev: Pre-requisites for ODT export,  Up: OpenDocument Text Export

12.12.2 ODT export commands
---------------------------

‘C-c C-e o o’ (‘org-export-to-odt’)
     Export as OpenDocument Text file.

     If ‘org-odt-preferred-output-format’ is specified, the ODT export
     back-end automatically converts the exported file to that format.

     For ‘myfile.org’, Org exports to ‘myfile.odt’, overwriting without
     warning.  The ODT export back-end exports a region only if a region
     was active.

     If the selected region is a single tree, the ODT export back-end
     makes the tree head the document title.  Incidentally, ‘C-c @’
     selects the current sub-tree.  If the tree head entry has, or
     inherits, an ‘EXPORT_FILE_NAME’ property, the ODT export back-end
     uses that for file name.

‘C-c C-e o O’
     Export as an OpenDocument Text file and open the resulting file.

     If ‘org-export-odt-preferred-output-format’ is specified, open the
     converted file instead.  See *note Automatically exporting to other
     formats::.


File: org,  Node: ODT specific export settings,  Next: Extending ODT export,  Prev: ODT export commands,  Up: OpenDocument Text Export

12.12.3 ODT specific export settings
------------------------------------

The ODT export back-end has several additional keywords for customizing
ODT output.  Setting these keywords works similar to the general options
(see *note Export Settings::).

‘DESCRIPTION’
     This is the document’s description, which the ODT export back-end
     inserts as document metadata.  For long descriptions, use multiple
     lines, prefixed with ‘DESCRIPTION’.

‘KEYWORDS’
     The keywords for the document.  The ODT export back-end inserts the
     description along with author name, keywords, and related file
     metadata as metadata in the output file.  Use multiple ‘KEYWORDS’
     if necessary.

‘ODT_STYLES_FILE’
     The ODT export back-end uses the ‘org-odt-styles-file’ by default.
     See *note Applying custom styles:: for details.

‘SUBTITLE’
     The document subtitle.


File: org,  Node: Extending ODT export,  Next: Applying custom styles,  Prev: ODT specific export settings,  Up: OpenDocument Text Export

12.12.4 Extending ODT export
----------------------------

The ODT export back-end can produce documents in other formats besides
ODT using a specialized ODT converter process.  Its common interface
works with popular converters to produce formats such as ‘doc’, or
convert a document from one format, say ‘csv’, to another format, say
‘xls’.

   Customize ‘org-odt-convert-process’ variable to point to ‘unoconv’,
which is the ODT’s preferred converter.  Working installations of
LibreOffice would already have ‘unoconv’ installed.  Alternatively,
other converters may be substituted here.  See *note Configuring a
document converter::.

Automatically exporting to other formats
........................................

If ODT format is just an intermediate step to get to other formats, such
as ‘doc’, ‘docx’, ‘rtf’, or ‘pdf’, etc., then extend the ODT export
back-end to directly produce that format.  Specify the final format in
the ‘org-odt-preferred-output-format’ variable.  This is one way to
extend (see *note ODT export commands::).

Converting between document formats
...................................

The Org export back-end is made to be inter-operable with a wide range
of text document format converters.  Newer generation converters, such
as LibreOffice and Pandoc, can handle hundreds of formats at once.  Org
provides a consistent interaction with whatever converter is installed.
Here are some generic commands:

‘M-x org-odt-convert’
     Convert an existing document from one format to another.  With a
     prefix argument, opens the newly produced file.


File: org,  Node: Applying custom styles,  Next: Links in ODT export,  Prev: Extending ODT export,  Up: OpenDocument Text Export

12.12.5 Applying custom styles
------------------------------

The ODT export back-end comes with many OpenDocument styles (see *note
Working with OpenDocument style files::).  To expand or further
customize these built-in style sheets, either edit the style sheets
directly or generate them using an application such as LibreOffice.  The
example here shows creating a style using LibreOffice.

Applying custom styles: the easy way
....................................

  1. Create a sample ‘example.org’ file with settings as shown below,
     and export it to ODT format.

          #+OPTIONS: H:10 num:t

  2. Open the above ‘example.odt’ using LibreOffice.  Use the _Stylist_
     to locate the target styles, which typically have the “Org” prefix.
     Open one, modify, and save as either OpenDocument Text (ODT) or
     OpenDocument Template (OTT) file.

  3. Customize the variable ‘org-odt-styles-file’ and point it to the
     newly created file.  For additional configuration options, see
     *note Overriding factory styles: x-overriding-factory-styles.

     To apply an ODT style to a particular file, use the
     ‘ODT_STYLES_FILE’ keyword as shown in the example below:

          #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/example.ott"

     or

          #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png"))

Using third-party styles and templates
......................................

The ODT export back-end relies on many templates and style names.  Using
third-party styles and templates can lead to mismatches.  Templates
derived from built in ODT templates and styles seem to have fewer
problems.

12.12.6 Links in ODT export
---------------------------

ODT exporter creates native cross-references for internal links.  It
creates Internet-style links for all other links.

   A link with no description and pointing to a regular, un-itemized,
outline heading is replaced with a cross-reference and section number of
the heading.

   A ‘\ref{label}’-style reference to an image, table etc., is replaced
with a cross-reference and sequence number of the labeled entity.  See
*note Labels and captions in ODT export::.


File: org,  Node: Tables in ODT export,  Next: Images in ODT export,  Prev: Links in ODT export,  Up: OpenDocument Text Export

12.12.7 Tables in ODT export
----------------------------

The ODT export back-end handles native Org mode tables (see *note
Tables::) and simple ‘table.el’ tables.  Complex ‘table.el’ tables
having column or row spans are not supported.  Such tables are stripped
from the exported document.

   By default, the ODT export back-end exports a table with top and
bottom frames and with ruled lines separating row and column groups (see
*note Column Groups::).  All tables are typeset to occupy the same
width.  The ODT export back-end honors any table alignments and relative
widths for columns (see *note Column Width and Alignment::).

   Note that the ODT export back-end interprets column widths as
weighted ratios, the default weight being 1.

   Specifying ‘:rel-width’ property on an ‘ATTR_ODT’ line controls the
width of the table.  For example:

     #+ATTR_ODT: :rel-width 50
     | Area/Month    |   Jan |   Feb |   Mar |   Sum |
     |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
     | /             |     < |       |       |     < |
     | <l13>         |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r6> |
     | North America |     1 |    21 |   926 |   948 |
     | Middle East   |     6 |    75 |   844 |   925 |
     | Asia Pacific  |     9 |    27 |   790 |   826 |
     |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
     | Sum           |    16 |   123 |  2560 |  2699 |

   On export, the above table takes 50% of text width area.  The
exporter sizes the columns in the ratio: 13:5:5:5:6.  The first column
is left-aligned and rest of the columns, right-aligned.  Vertical rules
separate the header and the last column.  Horizontal rules separate the
header and the last row.

   For even more customization, create custom table styles and associate
them with a table using the ‘ATTR_ODT’ keyword.  See *note Customizing
tables in ODT export::.

12.12.8 Images in ODT export
----------------------------

Embedding images
................

The ODT export back-end processes image links in Org files that do not
have descriptions, such as these links ‘[[file:img.jpg]]’ or
‘[[./img.jpg]]’, as direct image insertions in the final output.  Either
of these examples works:

     [[file:img.png]]

     [[./img.png]]

Embedding clickable images
..........................

For clickable images, provide a link whose description is another link
to an image file.  For example, to embed an image ‘org-mode-unicorn.png’
which when clicked jumps to <https://orgmode.org> website, do the
following

     [[https://orgmode.org][./org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Sizing and scaling of embedded images
.....................................

Control the size and scale of the embedded images with the ‘ATTR_ODT’
attribute.

   The ODT export back-end starts with establishing the size of the
image in the final document.  The dimensions of this size are measured
in centimeters.  The back-end then queries the image file for its
dimensions measured in pixels.  For this measurement, the back-end
relies on ImageMagick’s identify program or Emacs ‘create-image’ and
‘image-size’ API.  ImageMagick is the preferred choice for large file
sizes or frequent batch operations.  The back-end then converts the
pixel dimensions using ‘org-odt-pixels-per-inch’ into the familiar 72
dpi or 96 dpi.  The default value for this is in
‘display-pixels-per-inch’, which can be tweaked for better results based
on the capabilities of the output device.  Here are some common image
scaling operations:

Explicitly size the image
     To embed ‘img.png’ as a 10 cm x 10 cm image, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10 :height 10
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image
     To embed ‘img.png’ at half its size, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :scale 0.5
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image to a specific width
     To embed ‘img.png’ with a width of 10 cm while retaining the
     original height:width ratio, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10
          [[./img.png]]

Scale the image to a specific height
     To embed ‘img.png’ with a height of 10 cm while retaining the
     original height:width ratio, do the following:

          #+ATTR_ODT: :height 10
          [[./img.png]]

Anchoring of images
...................

The ODT export back-end can anchor images to ‘as-char’, ‘paragraph’, or
‘page’.  Set the preferred anchor using the ‘:anchor’ property of the
‘ATTR_ODT’ line.

   To create an image that is anchored to a page:

     #+ATTR_ODT: :anchor page
     [[./img.png]]

12.12.9.1 LaTeX math snippets
.............................

LaTeX math snippets (see *note LaTeX fragments::) can be embedded in the
ODT document in one of the following ways:

MathML
     Add this line to the Org file.  This option is activated on a
     per-file basis.

          #+OPTIONS: tex:t

     With this option, LaTeX fragments are first converted into MathML
     fragments using an external LaTeX-to-MathML converter program.  The
     resulting MathML fragments are then embedded as an OpenDocument
     Formula in the exported document.

     You can specify the LaTeX-to-MathML converter by customizing the
     variables ‘org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command’ and
     ‘org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file’.

     If you prefer to use MathToWeb(1) as your converter, you can
     configure the above variables as shown below.

          (setq org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
                "java -jar %j -unicode -force -df %o %I"
                org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file
                "/path/to/mathtoweb.jar")

     or, to use LaTeX​ML(2) instead,

          (setq org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
                "latexmlmath \"%i\" --presentationmathml=%o")

     To quickly verify the reliability of the LaTeX-to-MathML converter,
     use the following commands:

     ‘M-x org-export-as-odf’
          Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
          (‘.odf’) file.

     ‘M-x org-export-as-odf-and-open’
          Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
          (‘.odf’) file and open the formula file with the
          system-registered application.

PNG images
     Add this line to the Org file.  This option is activated on a
     per-file basis.

          #+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng

          #+OPTIONS: tex:dvisvgm

     or

          #+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick

     Under this option, LaTeX fragments are processed into PNG or SVG
     images and the resulting images are embedded in the exported
     document.  This method requires dvipng program, dvisvgm or
     ImageMagick programs.

12.12.9.2 MathML and OpenDocument formula files
...............................................

When embedding LaTeX math snippets in ODT documents is not reliable,
there is one more option to try.  Embed an equation by linking to its
MathML (‘.mml’) source or its OpenDocument formula (‘.odf’) file as
shown below:

     [[./equation.mml]]

or

     [[./equation.odf]]

12.12.10 Labels and captions in ODT export
------------------------------------------

ODT format handles labeling and captioning of objects based on their
types.  Inline images, tables, LaTeX fragments, and Math formulas are
numbered and captioned separately.  Each object also gets a unique
sequence number based on its order of first appearance in the Org file.
Each category has its own sequence.  A caption is just a label applied
to these objects.

     #+CAPTION: Bell curve
     #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
     [[./img/a.png]]

   When rendered, it may show as follows in the exported document:

     Figure 2: Bell curve

   To modify the category component of the caption, customize the option
‘org-odt-category-map-alist’.  For example, to tag embedded images with
the string “Illustration” instead of the default string “Figure”, use
the following setting:

     (setq org-odt-category-map-alist
           '(("__Figure__" "Illustration" "value" "Figure" org-odt--enumerable-image-p)))

   With the above modification, the previous example changes to:

     Illustration 2: Bell curve

12.12.11 Literal examples in ODT export
---------------------------------------

The ODT export back-end supports literal examples (see *note Literal
Examples::) with full fontification.  Internally, the ODT export
back-end relies on ‘htmlfontify.el’ to generate the style definitions
needed for fancy listings.  The auto-generated styles get ‘OrgSrc’
prefix and inherit colors from the faces used by Emacs Font Lock library
for that source language.

   For custom fontification styles, customize the
‘org-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks’ option.

   To turn off fontification of literal examples, customize the
‘org-odt-fontify-srcblocks’ option.

12.12.12 Advanced topics in ODT export
--------------------------------------

The ODT export back-end has extensive features useful for power users
and frequent uses of ODT formats.

Configuring a document converter
................................

The ODT export back-end works with popular converters with little or no
extra configuration.  See *note Extending ODT export::.  The following
is for unsupported converters or tweaking existing defaults.

Register the converter
     Add the name of the converter to the ‘org-odt-convert-processes’
     variable.  Note that it also requires how the converter is invoked
     on the command line.  See the variable’s docstring for details.

Configure its capabilities
     Specify which formats the converter can handle by customizing the
     variable ‘org-odt-convert-capabilities’.  Use the entry for the
     default values in this variable for configuring the new converter.
     Also see its docstring for details.

Choose the converter
     Select the newly added converter as the preferred one by
     customizing the option ‘org-odt-convert-process’.

Working with OpenDocument style files
.....................................

This section explores the internals of the ODT exporter; the means by
which it produces styled documents; the use of automatic and custom
OpenDocument styles.

   The ODT exporter relies on two files for generating its output.
These files are bundled with the distribution under the directory
pointed to by the variable ‘org-odt-styles-dir’.  The two files are:

‘OrgOdtStyles.xml’ 
     This file contributes to the ‘styles.xml’ file of the final ODT
     document.  This file gets modified for the following purposes:

       1. To control outline numbering based on user settings;

       2. To add styles generated by ‘htmlfontify.el’ for fontification
          of code blocks.

‘OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml’ 
     This file contributes to the ‘content.xml’ file of the final ODT
     document.  The contents of the Org outline are inserted between the
     ‘<office:text>’ ... ‘</office:text>’ elements of this file.

     Apart from serving as a template file for the final ‘content.xml’,
     the file serves the following purposes:

       1. It contains automatic styles for formatting of tables which
          are referenced by the exporter;

       2. It contains ‘<text:sequence-decl>’ ... ‘</text:sequence-decl>’
          elements that control numbering of tables, images, equations,
          and similar entities.

   The following two variables control the location from where the ODT
exporter picks up the custom styles and content template files.
Customize these variables to override the factory styles used by the
exporter.

‘org-odt-styles-file’
     The ODT export back-end uses the file pointed to by this variable,
     such as ‘styles.xml’, for the final output.  It can take one of the
     following values:

     ‘FILE.xml’
          Use this file instead of the default ‘styles.xml’

     ‘FILE.odt’ or ‘FILE.ott’
          Use the ‘styles.xml’ contained in the specified OpenDocument
          Text or Template file

     ‘FILE.odt’ or ‘FILE.ott’ and a subset of included files
          Use the ‘styles.xml’ contained in the specified OpenDocument
          Text or Template file.  Additionally extract the specified
          member files and embed those within the final ODT document.

          Use this option if the ‘styles.xml’ file references additional
          files like header and footer images.

     ‘nil’
          Use the default ‘styles.xml’.

‘org-odt-content-template-file’
     Use this variable to specify the blank ‘content.xml’ used in the
     final output.

Creating one-off styles
.......................

The ODT export back-end can read embedded raw OpenDocument XML from the
Org file.  Such direct formatting is useful for one-off instances.

Embedding ODT tags as part of regular text
     Enclose OpenDocument syntax in ‘@@odt:...@@’ for inline markup.
     For example, to highlight a region of text do the following:

          @@odt:<text:span text:style-name="Highlight">This is highlighted
          text</text:span>@@.  But this is regular text.

     *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit the ‘styles.xml’
     (see *note Factory styles: x-orgodtstyles-xml.) and add a custom
     _Highlight_ style as shown below:

          <style:style style:name="Highlight" style:family="text">
            <style:text-properties fo:background-color="#ff0000"/>
          </style:style>

Embedding a one-line OpenDocument XML
     The ODT export back-end can read one-liner options with ‘#+ODT:’ in
     the Org file.  For example, to force a page break:

          #+ODT: <text:p text:style-name="PageBreak"/>

     *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit your ‘styles.xml’
     (see *note Factory styles: x-orgodtstyles-xml.) and add a custom
     ‘PageBreak’ style as shown below.

          <style:style style:name="PageBreak" style:family="paragraph"
                       style:parent-style-name="Text_20_body">
            <style:paragraph-properties fo:break-before="page"/>
          </style:style>

Embedding a block of OpenDocument XML
     The ODT export back-end can also read ODT export blocks for
     OpenDocument XML.  Such blocks use the ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT odt’ ...
     ‘#+END_EXPORT’ constructs.

     For example, to create a one-off paragraph that uses bold text, do
     the following:

          #+BEGIN_EXPORT odt
            <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body_20_bold">
            This paragraph is specially formatted and uses bold text.
            </text:p>
          #+END_EXPORT

Customizing tables in ODT export
................................

Override the default table format by specifying a custom table style
with the ‘#+ATTR_ODT’ line.  For a discussion on default formatting of
tables, see *note Tables in ODT export::.

   This feature closely mimics the way table templates are defined in
the OpenDocument-v1.2 specification(1).

   For quick preview of this feature, install the settings below and
export the table that follows:

     (setq org-export-odt-table-styles
           (append org-export-odt-table-styles
                   '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                      ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                       (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                     ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                      ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                       (use-last-row-styles . t))))))

     #+ATTR_ODT: :style TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn
     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   The example above used ‘Custom’ template and installed two table
styles ‘TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn’ and ‘TableWithFirstRowandLastRow’.
*Important:* The OpenDocument styles needed for producing the above
template were pre-defined.  They are available in the section marked
‘Custom Table Template’ in ‘OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml’ (see *note
Factory styles: x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml.).  For adding new
templates, define new styles there.

   To use this feature proceed as follows:

  1. Create a table template(2).

     A table template is set of ‘table-cell’ and ‘paragraph’ styles for
     each of the following table cell categories:

        • Body
        • First column
        • Last column
        • First row
        • Last row
        • Even row
        • Odd row
        • Even column
        • Odd Column

     The names for the above styles must be chosen based on the name of
     the table template using a well-defined convention.

     The naming convention is better illustrated with an example.  For a
     table template with the name ‘Custom’, the needed style names are
     listed in the following table.

     Cell type      Cell style                     Paragraph style
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Body           ‘CustomTableCell’              ‘CustomTableParagraph’
     First column   ‘CustomFirstColumnTableCell’   ‘CustomFirstColumnTableParagraph’
     Last column    ‘CustomLastColumnTableCell’    ‘CustomLastColumnTableParagraph’
     First row      ‘CustomFirstRowTableCell’      ‘CustomFirstRowTableParagraph’
     Last row       ‘CustomLastRowTableCell’       ‘CustomLastRowTableParagraph’
     Even row       ‘CustomEvenRowTableCell’       ‘CustomEvenRowTableParagraph’
     Odd row        ‘CustomOddRowTableCell’        ‘CustomOddRowTableParagraph’
     Even column    ‘CustomEvenColumnTableCell’    ‘CustomEvenColumnTableParagraph’
     Odd column     ‘CustomOddColumnTableCell’     ‘CustomOddColumnTableParagraph’

     To create a table template with the name ‘Custom’, define the above
     styles in the ‘<office:automatic-styles>’ ...
     ‘</office:automatic-styles>’ element of the content template file
     (see *note Factory styles: x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml.).

  2. Define a table style(3).

     To define a table style, create an entry for the style in the
     variable ‘org-odt-table-styles’ and specify the following:

        • the name of the table template created in step (1),
        • the set of cell styles in that template that are to be
          activated.

     For example, the entry below defines two different table styles
     ‘TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn’ and ‘TableWithFirstRowandLastRow’
     based on the same template ‘Custom’.  The styles achieve their
     intended effect by selectively activating the individual cell
     styles in that template.

          (setq org-export-odt-table-styles
                (append org-export-odt-table-styles
                        '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                           ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                            (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                          ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                           ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                            (use-last-row-styles . t))))))

  3. Associate a table with the table style.

     To do this, specify the table style created in step (2) as part of
     the ‘ATTR_ODT’ line as shown below.

          #+ATTR_ODT: :style TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn
          | Name  | Phone | Age |
          | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
          | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

Validating OpenDocument XML
...........................

Sometimes ODT format files may not open due to ‘.odt’ file corruption.
To verify if such a file is corrupt, validate it against the
OpenDocument Relax NG Compact (RNC) syntax schema.  But first the ‘.odt’
files have to be decompressed using ‘zip’.  Note that ‘.odt’ files are
ZIP archives: *note (emacs)File Archives::.  The contents of ODT files
are in XML.  For general help with validation—and schema-sensitive
editing—of XML files: *note (nxml-mode)Introduction::.

   Customize ‘org-odt-schema-dir’ to point to a directory with
OpenDocument RNC files and the needed schema-locating rules.  The ODT
export back-end takes care of updating the ‘rng-schema-locating-files’.

12.14.2 Texinfo specific export settings
----------------------------------------

The Texinfo export back-end has several additional keywords for
customizing Texinfo output.  Setting these keywords works similar to the
general options (see *note Export Settings::).

‘SUBTITLE’
     The document subtitle.

‘SUBAUTHOR’
     Additional authors for the document.

‘TEXINFO_FILENAME’
     The Texinfo filename.

‘TEXINFO_CLASS’
     The default document class (‘org-texinfo-default-class’), which
     must be a member of ‘org-texinfo-classes’.

‘TEXINFO_HEADER’
     Arbitrary lines inserted at the end of the header.

‘TEXINFO_POST_HEADER’
     Arbitrary lines inserted after the end of the header.

‘TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY’
     The directory category of the document.

‘TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE’
     The directory title of the document.

‘TEXINFO_DIR_DESC’
     The directory description of the document.

‘TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE’
     The printed title of the document.


File: org,  Node: Texinfo file header,  Next: Texinfo title and copyright page,  Prev: Texinfo specific export settings,  Up: Texinfo Export

12.14.3 Texinfo file header
---------------------------

After creating the header for a Texinfo file, the Texinfo back-end
automatically generates a name and destination path for the Info file.
To override this default with a more sensible path and name, specify the
‘TEXINFO_FILENAME’ keyword.

   Along with the output’s file name, the Texinfo header also contains
language details (see *note Export Settings::) and encoding system as
set in the ‘org-texinfo-coding-system’ variable.  Insert
‘TEXINFO_HEADER’ keywords for each additional command in the header, for
example:

     #+TEXINFO_HEADER: @synindex

   Instead of repeatedly installing the same set of commands, define a
class in ‘org-texinfo-classes’ once, and then activate it in the
document by setting the ‘TEXINFO_CLASS’ keyword to that class.


File: org,  Node: Texinfo title and copyright page,  Next: Info directory file,  Prev: Texinfo file header,  Up: Texinfo Export

12.14.4 Texinfo title and copyright page
----------------------------------------

The default template for hard copy output has a title page with ‘TITLE’
and ‘AUTHOR’ keywords (see *note Export Settings::).  To replace the
regular title with something different for the printed version, use the
‘TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE’ and ‘SUBTITLE’ keywords.  Both expect raw
Texinfo code for setting their values.

   If one ‘AUTHOR’ line is not sufficient, add multiple ‘SUBAUTHOR’
keywords.  They have to be set in raw Texinfo code.

     #+AUTHOR: Jane Smith
     #+SUBAUTHOR: John Doe
     #+TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE: This Long Title@@inlinefmt{tex,@*} Is Broken in @TeX{}

   Copying material is defined in a dedicated headline with a non-‘nil’
‘COPYING’ property.  The back-end inserts the contents within a
‘@copying’ command at the beginning of the document.  The heading itself
does not appear in the structure of the document.

   Copyright information is printed on the back of the title page.

     * Legalese
       :PROPERTIES:
       :COPYING: t
       :END:

       This is a short example of a complete Texinfo file, version 1.0.

12.14.5 Info directory file
---------------------------

The end result of the Texinfo export process is the creation of an Info
file.  This Info file’s metadata has variables for category, title, and
description: ‘TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY’, ‘TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE’, and
‘TEXINFO_DIR_DESC’ keywords that establish where in the Info hierarchy
the file fits.

   Here is an example that writes to the Info directory file:

     #+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
     #+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE: Org Mode: (org)
     #+TEXINFO_DIR_DESC: Outline-based notes management and organizer


File: org,  Node: Headings and sectioning structure,  Next: Indices,  Prev: Info directory file,  Up: Texinfo Export

12.14.6 Headings and sectioning structure
-----------------------------------------

The Texinfo export back-end uses a pre-defined scheme to convert Org
headlines to equivalent Texinfo structuring commands.  A scheme like
this maps top-level headlines to numbered chapters tagged as ‘@chapter’
and lower-level headlines to unnumbered chapters tagged as
‘@unnumbered’.  To override such mappings to introduce ‘@part’ or other
Texinfo structuring commands, define a new class in
‘org-texinfo-classes’.  Activate the new class with the ‘TEXINFO_CLASS’
keyword.  When no new class is defined and activated, the Texinfo export
back-end defaults to the ‘org-texinfo-default-class’.

   If an Org headline’s level has no associated Texinfo structuring
command, or is below a certain threshold (see *note Export Settings::),
then the Texinfo export back-end makes it into a list item.

   The Texinfo export back-end makes any headline with a non-‘nil’
‘APPENDIX’ property into an appendix.  This happens independent of the
Org headline level or the ‘TEXINFO_CLASS’ keyword.

   The Texinfo export back-end creates a menu entry after the Org
headline for each regular sectioning structure.  To override this with a
shorter menu entry, use the ‘ALT_TITLE’ property (see *note Table of
Contents::).  Texinfo menu entries also have an option for a longer
‘DESCRIPTION’ property.  Here’s an example that uses both to override
the default menu entry:

     * Controlling Screen Display
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ALT_TITLE: Display
       :DESCRIPTION: Controlling Screen Display
       :END:

   The text before the first headline belongs to the _Top_ node, i.e.,
the node in which a reader enters an Info manual.  As such, it is
expected not to appear in printed output generated from the ‘.texi’
file.  See *note (texinfo)The Top Node::, for more information.


File: org,  Node: Indices,  Next: Quoting Texinfo code,  Prev: Headings and sectioning structure,  Up: Texinfo Export

12.14.7 Indices
---------------

The Texinfo export back-end recognizes these indexing keywords if used
in the Org file: ‘CINDEX’, ‘FINDEX’, ‘KINDEX’, ‘PINDEX’, ‘TINDEX’ and
‘VINDEX’.  Write their value as verbatim Texinfo code; in particular,
‘{’, ‘}’ and ‘@’ characters need to be escaped with ‘@’ if they do not
belong to a Texinfo command.

     #+CINDEX: Defining indexing entries

   For the back-end to generate an index entry for a headline, set the
‘INDEX’ property to ‘cp’ or ‘vr’.  These abbreviations come from Texinfo
that stand for concept index and variable index.  The Texinfo manual has
abbreviations for all other kinds of indexes.  The back-end exports the
headline as an unnumbered chapter or section command, and then inserts
the index after its contents.

12.14.9 Plain lists in Texinfo export
-------------------------------------

The Texinfo export back-end by default converts description lists in the
Org file using the default command ‘@table’, which results in a table
with two columns.  To change this behavior, specify ‘:table-type’ with
‘ftable’ or ‘vtable’ attributes.  For more information, see *note
(texinfo)Two-column Tables::.

   The Texinfo export back-end by default also applies a text highlight
based on the defaults stored in ‘org-texinfo-table-default-markup’.  To
override the default highlight command, specify another one with the
‘:indic’ attribute.

   Org syntax is limited to one entry per list item.  Nevertheless, the
Texinfo export back-end can split that entry according to any text
provided through the ‘:sep’ attribute.  Each part then becomes a new
entry in the first column of the table.

   The following example illustrates all the attributes above:

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :table-type vtable :sep , :indic asis
     - foo, bar :: This is the common text for variables foo and bar.

becomes

     @vtable @asis
     @item foo
     @itemx bar
     This is the common text for variables foo and bar.
     @end table

12.14.10 Tables in Texinfo export
---------------------------------

When exporting tables, the Texinfo export back-end uses the widest cell
width in each column.  To override this and instead specify as fractions
of line length, use the ‘:columns’ attribute.  See example below.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :columns .5 .5
     | a cell | another cell |

12.14.11 Images in Texinfo export
---------------------------------

Insert a file link to the image in the Org file, and the Texinfo export
back-end inserts the image.  These links must have the usual supported
image extensions and no descriptions.  To scale the image, use ‘:width’
and ‘:height’ attributes.  For alternate text, use ‘:alt’ and specify
the text using Texinfo code, as shown in the example:

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :width 1in :alt Alternate @i{text}
     [[ridt.pdf]]

12.14.12 Quotations in Texinfo export
-------------------------------------

You can write the text of a quotation within a quote block (see *note
Paragraphs::).  You may also emphasize some text at the beginning of the
quotation with the ‘:tag’ attribute.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Warning
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Striking your thumb with a hammer may cause severe pain and discomfort.
     #+END_QUOTE

   To specify the author of the quotation, use the ‘:author’ attribute.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :author King Arthur
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
     held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine

-----------------------------------------

The Texinfo export back-end converts special blocks to commands with the
same name.  It also adds any ‘:options’ attributes to the end of the
command, as shown in this example:

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :options org-org-export-to-org ...
     #+BEGIN_defun
       A somewhat obsessive function name.

File: org,  Node: iCalendar Export,  Next: Other Built-in Back-ends,  Prev: Texinfo Export,  Up: Exporting

12.15 iCalendar Export
======================

A large part of Org mode’s interoperability success is its ability to
easily export to or import from external applications.  The iCalendar
export back-end takes calendar data from Org files and exports to the
standard iCalendar format.

   The iCalendar export back-end can also incorporate TODO entries based
on the configuration of the ‘org-icalendar-include-todo’ variable.  The
back-end exports plain timestamps as ‘VEVENT’, TODO items as ‘VTODO’,
and also create events from deadlines that are in non-TODO items.  The
back-end uses the deadlines and scheduling dates in Org TODO items for
setting the start and due dates for the iCalendar TODO entry.  Consult
the ‘org-icalendar-use-deadline’ and ‘org-icalendar-use-scheduled’
variables for more details.

   For tags on the headline, the iCalendar export back-end makes them
into iCalendar categories.  To tweak the inheritance of tags and TODO
states, configure the variable ‘org-icalendar-categories’.  To assign
clock alarms based on time, configure the ‘org-icalendar-alarm-time’
variable.

   The iCalendar format standard requires globally unique identifier—or
UID—for each entry.  The iCalendar export back-end creates UIDs during
export.  To save a copy of the UID in the Org file set the variable
‘org-icalendar-store-UID’.  The back-end looks for the ‘ID’ property of
the entry for re-using the same UID for subsequent exports.

   Since a single Org entry can result in multiple iCalendar
entries—timestamp, deadline, scheduled item, or TODO item—Org adds
prefixes to the UID, depending on which part of the Org entry triggered
the creation of the iCalendar entry.  Prefixing ensures UIDs remains
unique, yet enable synchronization programs trace the connections.

‘C-c C-e c f’ (‘org-icalendar-export-to-ics’)
     Create iCalendar entries from the current Org buffer and store them
     in the same directory, using a file extension ‘.ics’.

‘C-c C-e c a’ (‘org-icalendar-export-agenda-files’)
     Create iCalendar entries from Org files in ‘org-agenda-files’ and
     store in a separate iCalendar file for each Org file.

‘C-c C-e c c’ (‘org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files’)
     Create a combined iCalendar file from Org files in
     ‘org-agenda-files’ and write it to
     ‘org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file’ file name.

   The iCalendar export back-end includes ‘SUMMARY’, ‘DESCRIPTION’,
‘LOCATION’ and ‘TIMEZONE’ properties from the Org entries when
exporting.  To force the back-end to inherit the ‘LOCATION’ and
‘TIMEZONE’ properties, configure the ‘org-use-property-inheritance’
variable.

   When Org entries do not have ‘SUMMARY’, ‘DESCRIPTION’ and ‘LOCATION’
properties, the iCalendar export back-end derives the summary from the
headline, and derives the description from the body of the Org item.
The ‘org-icalendar-include-body’ variable limits the maximum number of
characters of the content are turned into its description.

   The ‘TIMEZONE’ property can be used to specify a per-entry time zone,
and is applied to any entry with timestamp information.  Time zones
should be specified as per the IANA time zone database format, e.g.,
‘Asia/Almaty’.  Alternately, the property value can be ‘UTC’, to force
UTC time for this entry only.

   Exporting to iCalendar format depends in large part on the
capabilities of the destination application.  Some are more lenient than
others.  Consult the Org mode FAQ for advice on specific applications.

12.16 Other Built-in Back-ends
==============================

Other export back-ends included with Org are:

   • ‘ox-man.el’: Export to a man page.

   To activate such back-ends, either customize ‘org-export-backends’ or
load directly with ‘(require 'ox-man)’.  On successful load, the
back-end adds new keys in the export dispatcher (see *note The Export
Dispatcher::).

   Follow the comment section of such files, for example, ‘ox-man.el’,
for usage and configuration details.

12.17 Advanced Export Configuration
===================================

Hooks
-----

The export process executes two hooks before the actual exporting
begins.  The first hook, ‘org-export-before-processing-hook’, runs
before any expansions of macros, Babel code, and include keywords in the
buffer.  The second hook, ‘org-export-before-parsing-hook’, runs before
the buffer is parsed.

   Functions added to these hooks are called with a single argument: the
export back-end actually used, as a symbol.  You may use them for heavy
duty structural modifications of the document.  For example, you can
remove every headline in the buffer during export like this:

     (defun my-headline-removal (backend)
       "Remove all headlines in the current buffer.
     BACKEND is the export back-end being used, as a symbol."
       (org-map-entries
        (lambda () (delete-region (point) (line-beginning-position 2)))))

     (add-hook 'org-export-before-parsing-hook 'my-headline-removal)

Filters
-------

Filters are lists of functions to be applied to certain parts for a
given back-end.  The output from the first function in the filter is
passed on to the next function in the filter.  The final output is the
output from the final function in the filter.

   The Org export process has many filter sets applicable to different
types of objects, plain text, parse trees, export options, and final
output formats.  The filters are named after the element type or object
type: ‘org-export-filter-TYPE-functions’, where TYPE is the type
targeted by the filter.  Valid types are:

body                     bold                     babel-call
center-block             clock                    code
diary-sexp               drawer                   dynamic-block
entity                   example-block            export-block
export-snippet           final-output             fixed-width
footnote-definition      footnote-reference       headline
horizontal-rule          inline-babel-call        inline-src-block
inlinetask               italic                   item
keyword                  latex-environment        latex-fragment
line-break               link                     node-property
options                  paragraph                parse-tree
plain-list               plain-text               planning
property-drawer          quote-block              radio-target
section                  special-block            src-block
statistics-cookie        strike-through           subscript
superscript              table                    table-cell
table-row                target                   timestamp
underline                verbatim                 verse-block

   Here is an example filter that replaces non-breaking spaces ‘ ’ in
the Org buffer with ‘~’ for the LaTeX back-end.

     (defun my-latex-filter-nobreaks (text backend info)
       "Ensure \" \" are properly handled in LaTeX export."
       (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
         (replace-regexp-in-string " " "~" text)))

     (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-plain-text-functions
                  'my-latex-filter-nobreaks)

   A filter requires three arguments: the code to be transformed, the
name of the back-end, and some optional information about the export
process.  The third argument can be safely ignored.  Note the use of
‘org-export-derived-backend-p’ predicate that tests for _latex_ back-end
or any other back-end, such as _beamer_, derived from _latex_.

Defining filters for individual files
-------------------------------------

The Org export can filter not just for back-ends, but also for specific
files through the ‘BIND’ keyword.  Here is an example with two filters;
one removes brackets from time stamps, and the other removes
strike-through text.  The filter functions are defined in a code block
in the same Org file, which is a handy location for debugging.

     #+BIND: org-export-filter-timestamp-functions (tmp-f-timestamp)
     #+BIND: org-export-filter-strike-through-functions (tmp-f-strike-through)
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports results :results none
       (defun tmp-f-timestamp (s backend info)
         (replace-regexp-in-string "&[lg]t;\\|[][]" "" s))
       (defun tmp-f-strike-through (s backend info) "")
     #+END_SRC

Extending an existing back-end
------------------------------

Some parts of the conversion process can be extended for certain
elements so as to introduce a new or revised translation.  That is how
the HTML export back-end was extended to handle Markdown format.  The
extensions work seamlessly so any aspect of filtering not done by the
extended back-end is handled by the original back-end.  Of all the
export customization in Org, extending is very powerful as it operates
at the parser level.

   For this example, make the _ascii_ back-end display the language used
in a source code block.  Also make it display only when some attribute
is non-‘nil’, like the following:

     #+ATTR_ASCII: :language t

   Then extend ASCII back-end with a custom “my-ascii” back-end.

     (defun my-ascii-src-block (src-block contents info)
       "Transcode a SRC-BLOCK element from Org to ASCII.
     CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist used as a communication
     channel."
       (if (not (org-export-read-attribute :attr_ascii src-block :language))
           (org-export-with-backend 'ascii src-block contents info)
         (concat
          (format ",--[ %s ]--\n%s`----"
                  (org-element-property :language src-block)
                  (replace-regexp-in-string
                   "^" "| "
                   (org-element-normalize-string
                    (org-export-format-code-default src-block info)))))))

     (org-export-define-derived-backend 'my-ascii 'ascii
       :translate-alist '((src-block . my-ascii-src-block)))

   The ‘my-ascii-src-block’ function looks at the attribute above the
current element.  If not true, hands over to _ascii_ back-end.  If true,
which it is in this example, it creates a box around the code and leaves
room for the inserting a string for language.  The last form creates the
new back-end that springs to action only when translating ‘src-block’
type elements.

   To use the newly defined back-end, evaluate the following from an Org
buffer:

     (org-export-to-buffer 'my-ascii "*Org MY-ASCII Export*")

   Further steps to consider would be an interactive function,
self-installing an item in the export dispatcher menu, and other
user-friendly improvements.


File: org,  Node: Export in Foreign Buffers,  Prev: Advanced Export Configuration,  Up: Exporting

12.18 Export in Foreign Buffers
===============================

The export back-ends in Org often include commands to convert selected
regions.  A convenient feature of this in-place conversion is that the
exported output replaces the original source.  Here are such functions:

‘org-ascii-convert-region-to-ascii’
     Convert the selected region into ASCII.

‘org-ascii-convert-region-to-utf8’
     Convert the selected region into UTF-8.

‘org-html-convert-region-to-html’
     Convert the selected region into HTML.

‘org-latex-convert-region-to-latex’
     Convert the selected region into LaTeX.

‘org-texinfo-convert-region-to-texinfo’
     Convert the selected region into Texinfo.

‘org-md-convert-region-to-md’
     Convert the selected region into Markdown.

   In-place conversions are particularly handy for quick conversion of
tables and lists in foreign buffers.  For example, in an HTML buffer,
write a list in Org syntax, select it, and convert it to HTML with ‘M-x
org-html-convert-region-to-html’.

13 Publishing
*************

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to configure
automatic HTML conversion of _projects_ composed of interlinked Org
files.  You can also configure Org to automatically upload your exported
HTML pages and related attachments, such as images and source code
files, to a web server.

   You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML
and PDF conversion so that files are available in both formats on the
server.

   Publishing has been contributed to Org by David O’Toole.

13.1 Configuration
==================

Publishing needs significant configuration to specify files, destination
and many other properties of a project.

* Sources and destinations::     From here to there.

File: org,  Node: Project alist,  Next: Sources and destinations,  Up: Configuration

13.1.1 The variable ‘org-publish-project-alist’
-----------------------------------------------

Publishing is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called ‘org-publish-project-alist’.  Each element of the
list configures one project, and may be in one of the two following
forms:

     ("project-name" :property value :property value ...)

i.e., a well-formed property list with alternating keys and values, or:

     ("project-name" :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

   In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property values.
A project defines the set of files that are to be published, as well as
the publishing configuration to use when publishing those files.  When a
project takes the second form listed above, the individual members of
the ‘:components’ property are taken to be sub-projects, which group
together files requiring different publishing options.  When you publish
such a “meta-project”, all the components are also published, in the
sequence given.


File: org,  Node: Sources and destinations,  Next: Selecting files,  Prev: Project alist,  Up: Configuration

13.1.2 Sources and destinations for files
-----------------------------------------

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set.  In
particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files, and where
to put published files.

‘:base-directory’
     Directory containing publishing source files.

‘:publishing-directory’
     Directory where output files are published.  You can directly
     publish to a webserver using a file name syntax appropriate for the
     Emacs tramp package.  Or you can publish to a local directory and
     use external tools to upload your website (see *note Uploading
     Files::).

‘:preparation-function’
     Function or list of functions to be called before starting the
     publishing process, for example, to run ‘make’ for updating files
     to be published.  Each preparation function is called with a single
     argument, the project property list.

‘:completion-function’
     Function or list of functions called after finishing the publishing
     process, for example, to change permissions of the resulting files.
     Each completion function is called with a single argument, the
     project property list.


File: org,  Node: Selecting files,  Next: Publishing action,  Prev: Sources and destinations,  Up: Configuration

13.1.3 Selecting files
----------------------

By default, all files with extension ‘.org’ in the base directory are
considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
following properties

‘:base-extension’
     Extension—without the dot—of source files.  This actually is a
     regular expression.  Set this to the symbol ‘any’ if you want to
     get all files in ‘:base-directory’, even without extension.

‘:exclude’
     Regular expression to match file names that should not be
     published, even though they have been selected on the basis of
     their extension.

‘:include’
     List of files to be included regardless of ‘:base-extension’ and
     ‘:exclude’.

‘:recursive’
     Non-‘nil’ means, check base-directory recursively for files to
     publish.


File: org,  Node: Publishing action,  Next: Publishing options,  Prev: Selecting files,  Up: Configuration

13.1.4 Publishing action
------------------------

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to
export Org files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
‘org-publish-org-to-html’ which calls the HTML exporter (see *note HTML
Export::).  But you can also publish your content as PDF files using
‘org-publish-org-to-pdf’, or as ASCII, Texinfo, etc., using the
corresponding functions.

   If you want to publish the Org file as an ‘.org’ file but with
_archived_, _commented_, and _tag-excluded_ trees removed, use
‘org-publish-org-to-org’.  This produces ‘file.org’ and put it in the
publishing directory.  If you want a htmlized version of this file, set
the parameter ‘:htmlized-source’ to ‘t’.  It produces ‘file.org.html’ in
the publishing directory(1).

   Other files like images only need to be copied to the publishing
destination; for this you can use ‘org-publish-attachment’.  For non-Org
files, you always need to specify the publishing function:

‘:publishing-function’
     Function executing the publication of a file.  This may also be a
     list of functions, which are all called in turn.

‘:htmlized-source’
     Non-‘nil’ means, publish htmlized source.

   The function must accept three arguments: a property list containing
at least a ‘:publishing-directory’ property, the name of the file to be
published, and the path to the publishing directory of the output file.
It should take the specified file, make the necessary transformation, if
any, and place the result into the destination folder.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the publishing directory is the same as the source directory,
‘file.org’ is exported as ‘file.org.org’, so you probably do not want to
do this.

13.1.5 Options for the exporters
--------------------------------

The property list can be used to set many export options for the HTML
and LaTeX exporters.  In most cases, these properties correspond to user
variables in Org.  The table below lists these properties along with the
variable they belong to.  See the documentation string for the
respective variable for details.

   When a property is given a value in ‘org-publish-project-alist’, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable, if any,
during publishing.  Options set within a file (see *note Export
Settings::), however, override everything.

13.1.6 Publishing links
-----------------------

To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something
like ‘[[file:foo.org][The foo]]’ or simply ‘[[file:foo.org]]’ (see *note
External Links::).  When published, this link becomes a link to
‘foo.html’.  You can thus interlink the pages of your “Org web” project
and the links will work as expected when you publish them to HTML.  If
you also publish the Org source file and want to link to it, use an
‘http’ link instead of a ‘file:’ link, because ‘file’ links are
converted to link to the corresponding ‘.html’ file.

   You may also link to related files, such as images.  Provided you are
careful with relative file names, and provided you have also configured
Org to upload the related files, these links will work too.  See *note
Complex example::, for an example of this usage.

   Eventually, links between published documents can contain some search
options (see *note Search Options::), which will be resolved to the
appropriate location in the linked file.  For example, once published to
HTML, the following links all point to a dedicated anchor in ‘foo.html’.

     [[file:foo.org::*heading]]
     [[file:foo.org::#custom-id]]
     [[file:foo.org::target]]

13.1.7 Generating a sitemap
---------------------------

The following properties may be used to control publishing of a map of
files for a given project.

‘:auto-sitemap’
     When non-‘nil’, publish a sitemap during
     ‘org-publish-current-project’ or ‘org-publish-all’.

‘:sitemap-filename’
     Filename for output of sitemap.  Defaults to ‘sitemap.org’, which
     becomes ‘sitemap.html’.

‘:sitemap-title’
     Title of sitemap page.  Defaults to name of file.

‘:sitemap-format-entry’
     With this option one can tell how a site-map entry is formatted in
     the site-map.  It is a function called with three arguments: the
     file or directory name relative to base directory of the project,
     the site-map style and the current project.  It is expected to
     return a string.  Default value turns file names into links and use
     document titles as descriptions.  For specific formatting needs,
     one can use ‘org-publish-find-date’, ‘org-publish-find-title’ and
     ‘org-publish-find-property’, to retrieve additional information
     about published documents.

‘:sitemap-function’
     Plug-in function to use for generation of the sitemap.  It is
     called with two arguments: the title of the site-map and a
     representation of the files and directories involved in the project
     as a nested list, which can further be transformed using
     ‘org-list-to-generic’, ‘org-list-to-subtree’ and alike.  Default
     value generates a plain list of links to all files in the project.

‘:sitemap-sort-folders’
     Where folders should appear in the sitemap.  Set this to ‘first’
     (default) or ‘last’ to display folders first or last, respectively.
     When set to ‘ignore’, folders are ignored altogether.  Any other
     value mixes files and folders.  This variable has no effect when
     site-map style is ‘tree’.

‘:sitemap-sort-files’
     How the files are sorted in the site map.  Set this to
     ‘alphabetically’ (default), ‘chronologically’ or
     ‘anti-chronologically’.  ‘chronologically’ sorts the files with
     older date first while ‘anti-chronologically’ sorts the files with
     newer date first.  ‘alphabetically’ sorts the files alphabetically.
     The date of a file is retrieved with ‘org-publish-find-date’.

‘:sitemap-ignore-case’
     Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default ‘nil’.

‘:sitemap-file-entry-format’
     With this option one can tell how a sitemap’s entry is formatted in
     the sitemap.  This is a format string with some escape sequences:
     ‘%t’ stands for the title of the file, ‘%a’ stands for the author
     of the file and ‘%d’ stands for the date of the file.  The date is
     retrieved with the ‘org-publish-find-date’ function and formatted
     with ‘org-publish-sitemap-date-format’.  Default ‘%t’.

‘:sitemap-date-format’
     Format string for the ‘format-time-string’ function that tells how
     a sitemap entry’s date is to be formatted.  This property bypasses
     ‘org-publish-sitemap-date-format’ which defaults to ‘%Y-%m-%d’.

13.1.8 Generating an index
--------------------------

Org mode can generate an index across the files of a publishing project.

‘:makeindex’
     When non-‘nil’, generate in index in the file ‘theindex.org’ and
     publish it as ‘theindex.html’.

   The file is created when first publishing a project with the
‘:makeindex’ set.  The file only contains a statement ‘#+INCLUDE:
"theindex.inc"’.  You can then build around this include statement by
adding a title, style information, etc.

   Index entries are specified with ‘INDEX’ keyword.  An entry that
contains an exclamation mark creates a sub item.

13.2 Uploading Files
====================

For those people already utilizing third party sync tools such as Rsync
or Unison, it might be preferable not to use the built-in remote
publishing facilities of Org mode which rely heavily on Tramp.  Tramp,
while very useful and powerful, tends not to be so efficient for
multiple file transfer and has been known to cause problems under heavy
usage.

   Specialized synchronization utilities offer several advantages.  In
addition to timestamp comparison, they also do content and
permissions/attribute checks.  For this reason you might prefer to
publish your web to a local directory—possibly even _in place_ with your
Org files—and then use Unison or Rsync to do the synchronization with
the remote host.

   Since Unison, for example, can be configured as to which files to
transfer to a certain remote destination, it can greatly simplify the
project publishing definition.  Simply keep all files in the correct
location, process your Org files with ‘org-publish’ and let the
synchronization tool do the rest.  You do not need, in this scenario, to
include attachments such as JPG, CSS or PNG files in the project
definition since the third-party tool syncs them.

   Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a remote
one, so that you can afford more easily to republish entire projects.
If you set ‘org-publish-use-timestamps-flag’ to ‘nil’, you gain the main
benefit of re-including any changed external files such as source
example files you might include with ‘INCLUDE’ keyword.  The timestamp
mechanism in Org is not smart enough to detect if included files have
been modified.

13.3 Sample Configuration
=========================

Below we provide two example configurations.  The first one is a simple
project publishing only a set of Org files.  The second example is more
complex, with a multi-component project.

* Simple example::               One-component publishing.
* Complex example::              A multi-component publishing example.

13.3.1 Example: simple publishing configuration
-----------------------------------------------

This example publishes a set of Org files to the ‘public_html’ directory
on the local machine.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("org"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
              :section-numbers nil
              :table-of-contents nil
              :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                     href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                     type=\"text/css\"/>")))


File: org,  Node: Complex example,  Prev: Simple example,  Up: Sample Configuration

13.3.2 Example: complex publishing configuration
------------------------------------------------

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including Org
files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and style
sheets.  The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

   To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths.  For example, if your Org files are kept in ‘~/org/’ and your
publishable images in ‘~/images/’, you would link to an image with

     file:../images/myimage.png

   On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the same.
You can accomplish this by setting up an ‘images/’ folder in the right
place on the web server, and publishing images to it.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("orgfiles"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :base-extension "org"
              :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/"
              :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
              :exclude "PrivatePage.org" ;; regexp
              :headline-levels 3
              :section-numbers nil
              :with-toc nil
              :html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                       href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>"
              :html-preamble t)

             ("images"
              :base-directory "~/images/"
              :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
              :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/images/"
              :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

             ("other"
              :base-directory "~/other/"
              :base-extension "css\\|el"
              :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/other/"
              :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
             ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))


File: org,  Node: Triggering Publication,  Prev: Sample Configuration,  Up: Publishing

13.4 Triggering Publication
===========================

Once properly configured, Org can publish with the following commands:

‘C-c C-e X’ (‘org-publish’)
     Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to
     it.

‘C-c C-e P’ (‘org-publish-current-project’)
     Publish the project containing the current file.

‘C-c C-e F’ (‘org-publish-current-file’)
     Publish only the current file.

‘C-c C-e E’ (‘org-publish-all’)
     Publish every project.

   Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed.  The above
functions normally only publish changed files.  You can override this
and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of
the commands above, or by customizing the variable
‘org-publish-use-timestamps-flag’.  This may be necessary in particular
if files include other files via ‘SETUPFILE’ or ‘INCLUDE’ keywords.

14 Working with Source Code
***************************

Source code here refers to any plain text collection of computer
instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable
programming language.  Org can manage source code in an Org document
when the source code is identified with begin and end markers.  Working
with source code begins with identifying source code blocks.  A source
code block can be placed almost anywhere in an Org document; it is not
restricted to the preamble or the end of the document.  However, Org
cannot manage a source code block if it is placed inside an Org comment
or within a fixed width section.

   Here is an example source code block in the Emacs Lisp language:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun org-xor (a b)
          "Exclusive or."
          (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_SRC

   Org can manage the source code in the block delimited by
‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ ... ‘#+END_SRC’ in several ways that can simplify
housekeeping tasks essential to modern source code maintenance.  Org can
edit, format, extract, export, and publish source code blocks.  Org can
also compile and execute a source code block, then capture the results.
The Org mode literature sometimes refers to source code blocks as _live
code_ blocks because they can alter the content of the Org document or
the material that it exports.  Users can control how live they want each
source code block by tweaking the header arguments (see *note Using
Header Arguments::) for compiling, execution, extraction, and exporting.

   Source code blocks are one of many Org block types, which also
include “center”, “comment”, “dynamic”, “example”, “export”, “quote”,
“special”, and “verse”.  This section pertains to blocks between
‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ and ‘#+END_SRC’.

   For editing and formatting a source code block, Org uses an
appropriate Emacs major mode that includes features specifically
designed for source code in that language.

   Org can extract one or more source code blocks and write them to one
or more source files—a process known as _tangling_ in literate
programming terminology.

   For exporting and publishing, Org’s back-ends can format a source
code block appropriately, often with native syntax highlighting.

   For executing and compiling a source code block, the user can
configure Org to select the appropriate compiler.  Org provides
facilities to collect the result of the execution or compiler output,
insert it into the Org document, and/or export it.  In addition to text
results, Org can insert links to other data types, including audio,
video, and graphics.  Org can also link a compiler error message to the
appropriate line in the source code block.

   An important feature of Org’s management of source code blocks is the
ability to pass variables, functions, and results to one another using a
common syntax for source code blocks in any language.  Although most
literate programming facilities are restricted to one language or
another, Org’s language-agnostic approach lets the literate programmer
match each programming task with the appropriate computer language and
to mix them all together in a single Org document.  This
interoperability among languages explains why Org’s source code
management facility was named _Org Babel_ by its originators, Eric
Schulte and Dan Davison.

   Org mode fulfills the promise of easy verification and maintenance of
publishing reproducible research by keeping text, data, code,
configuration settings of the execution environment, the results of the
execution, and associated narratives, claims, references, and internal
and external links in a single Org document.

   Details of Org’s facilities for working with source code are

File: org,  Node: Structure of Code Blocks,  Next: Using Header Arguments,  Up: Working with Source Code

14.1 Structure of Code Blocks
=============================

Org offers two ways to structure source code in Org documents: in a
source code block, and directly inline.  Both specifications are shown
below.

   A source code block conforms to this structure:

     #+NAME: <name>
     #+BEGIN_SRC <language> <switches> <header arguments>
       <body>
     #+END_SRC

   Do not be put-off by having to remember the source block syntax.  Org
mode offers a command for wrapping existing text in a block (see *note
Structure Templates::).  Org also works with other completion systems in
Emacs, some of which predate Org and have custom domain-specific
languages for defining templates.  Regular use of templates reduces
errors, increases accuracy, and maintains consistency.

   An inline code block conforms to this structure:

     src_<language>{<body>}

or

     src_<language>[<header arguments>]{<body>}

‘#+NAME: <name>’
     Optional.  Names the source block so it can be called, like a
     function, from other source blocks or inline code to evaluate or to
     capture the results.  Code from other blocks, other files, and from
     table formulas (see *note The Spreadsheet::) can use the name to
     reference a source block.  This naming serves the same purpose as
     naming Org tables.  Org mode requires unique names.  For duplicate
     names, Org mode’s behavior is undefined.

‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ ... ‘#+END_SRC’
     Mandatory.  They mark the start and end of a block that Org
     requires.  The ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ line takes additional arguments, as
     described next.

‘<language>’
     Mandatory.  It is the identifier of the source code language in the
     block.  See *note Languages::, for identifiers of supported
     languages.

‘<switches>’
     Optional.  Switches provide finer control of the code execution,
     export, and format (see the discussion of switches in *note Literal
     Examples::).

‘<header arguments>’
     Optional.  Heading arguments control many aspects of evaluation,
     export and tangling of code blocks (see *note Using Header
     Arguments::).  Using Org’s properties feature, header arguments can
     be selectively applied to the entire buffer or specific sub-trees
     of the Org document.

‘<body>’
     Source code in the dialect of the specified language identifier.


File: org,  Node: Using Header Arguments,  Next: Environment of a Code Block,  Prev: Structure of Code Blocks,  Up: Working with Source Code

14.2 Using Header Arguments
===========================

Org comes with many header arguments common to all languages.  New
header arguments are added for specific languages as they become
available for use in source code blocks.  A header argument is specified
with an initial colon followed by the argument’s name in lowercase.

   Since header arguments can be set in several ways, Org prioritizes
them in case of overlaps or conflicts by giving local settings a higher
priority.  Header values in function calls, for example, override header
values from global defaults.

System-wide header arguments
----------------------------

System-wide values of header arguments can be specified by customizing
the ‘org-babel-default-header-args’ variable, which defaults to the
following values:

     :session    => "none"
     :results    => "replace"
     :exports    => "code"
     :cache      => "no"
     :noweb      => "no"

   The example below sets ‘:noweb’ header arguments to ‘yes’, which
makes Org expand ‘:noweb’ references by default.

     (setq org-babel-default-header-args
           (cons '(:noweb . "yes")
                 (assq-delete-all :noweb org-babel-default-header-args)))

   Each language can have separate default header arguments by
customizing the variable ‘org-babel-default-header-args:<LANG>’, where
<LANG> is the name of the language.  For details, see the
language-specific online documentation at
<https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/>.

Header arguments in Org mode properties
---------------------------------------

For header arguments applicable to the buffer, use ‘PROPERTY’ keyword
anywhere in the Org file (see *note Property Syntax::).

   The following example makes all the R code blocks execute in the same
session.  Setting ‘:results’ to ‘silent’ ignores the results of
executions for all blocks, not just R code blocks; no results inserted
for any block.

     #+PROPERTY: header-args:R  :session *R*
     #+PROPERTY: header-args    :results silent

   Header arguments set through Org’s property drawers (see *note
Property Syntax::) apply at the sub-tree level on down.  Since these
property drawers can appear anywhere in the file hierarchy, Org uses
outermost call or source block to resolve the values.  Org ignores
‘org-use-property-inheritance’ setting.

   In this example, ‘:cache’ defaults to ‘yes’ for all code blocks in
the sub-tree.

     * sample header
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:    :cache yes
       :END:

   Properties defined through ‘org-set-property’ function, bound to ‘C-c
C-x p’, apply to all active languages.  They override properties set in
‘org-babel-default-header-args’.

   Language-specific header arguments are also read from properties
‘header-args:<LANG>’ where <LANG> is the language identifier.  For
example,

     * Heading
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-1*
       :header-args:R:          :session *R*
       :END:
     ** Subheading
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-2*
       :END:

would force separate sessions for Clojure blocks in ‘Heading’ and
‘Subheading’, but use the same session for all R blocks.  Blocks in
‘Subheading’ inherit settings from ‘Heading’.

Code block specific header arguments
------------------------------------

Header arguments are most commonly set at the source code block level,
on the ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ line.  Arguments set at this level take precedence
over those set in the ‘org-babel-default-header-args’ variable, and also
those set as header properties.

   In the following example, setting ‘:results’ to ‘silent’ makes it
ignore results of the code execution.  Setting ‘:exports’ to ‘code’
exports only the body of the code block to HTML or LaTeX.

     #+NAME: factorial
     #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0
       fac 0 = 1
       fac n = n * fac (n-1)
     #+END_SRC

   The same header arguments in an inline code block:

     src_haskell[:exports both]{fac 5}

   Code block header arguments can span multiple lines using ‘#+HEADER:’
on each line.  Note that Org currently accepts the plural spelling of
‘#+HEADER:’ only as a convenience for backward-compatibility.  It may be
removed at some point.

   Multi-line header arguments on an unnamed code block:

     #+HEADER: :var data1=1
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data2=2
        (message "data1:%S, data2:%S" data1 data2)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : data1:1, data2:2

   Multi-line header arguments on a named code block:

     #+NAME: named-block
     #+HEADER: :var data=2
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (message "data:%S" data)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: named-block
       : data:2

Header arguments in function calls
----------------------------------

Header arguments in function calls are the most specific and override
all other settings in case of an overlap.  They get the highest
priority.  Two ‘#+CALL:’ examples are shown below.  For the complete
syntax of ‘CALL’ keyword, see *note Evaluating Code Blocks::.

   In this example, ‘:exports results’ header argument is applied to the
evaluation of the ‘#+CALL:’ line.

     #+CALL: factorial(n=5) :exports results

   In this example, ‘:session special’ header argument is applied to the
evaluation of ‘factorial’ code block.

     #+CALL: factorial[:session special](n=5)

14.3 Environment of a Code Block
================================

Passing arguments
-----------------

Use ‘var’ for passing arguments to source code blocks.  The specifics of
variables in code blocks vary by the source language and are covered in
the language-specific documentation.  The syntax for ‘var’, however, is
the same for all languages.  This includes declaring a variable, and
assigning a default value.

   The following syntax is used to pass arguments to code blocks using
the ‘var’ header argument.

     :var NAME=ASSIGN

NAME is the name of the variable bound in the code block body.  ASSIGN
is a literal value, such as a string, a number, a reference to a table,
a list, a literal example, another code block—with or without
arguments—or the results of evaluating a code block.

   Here are examples of passing values by reference:

table
     A table named with a ‘NAME’ keyword.

          #+NAME: example-table
          | 1 |
          | 2 |
          | 3 |
          | 4 |

          #+NAME: table-length
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=example-table
            (length table)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: table-length
          : 4

     When passing a table, you can treat specially the row, or the
     column, containing labels for the columns, or the rows, in the
     table.

     The ‘colnames’ header argument accepts ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘nil’
     values.  The default value is ‘nil’: if an input table has column
     names—because the second row is a horizontal rule—then Org removes
     the column names, processes the table, puts back the column names,
     and then writes the table to the results block.  Using ‘yes’, Org
     does the same to the first row, even if the initial table does not
     contain any horizontal rule.  When set to ‘no’, Org does not
     pre-process column names at all.

          #+NAME: less-cols
          | a |
          |---|
          | b |
          | c |

          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=less-cols :colnames nil
            return [[val + '*' for val in row] for row in tab]
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          | a  |
          |----|
          | b* |
          | c* |

     Similarly, the ‘rownames’ header argument can take two values:
     ‘yes’ or ‘no’.  When set to ‘yes’, Org removes the first column,
     processes the table, puts back the first column, and then writes
     the table to the results block.  The default is ‘no’, which means
     Org does not pre-process the first column.  Note that Emacs Lisp
     code blocks ignore ‘rownames’ header argument because of the ease
     of table-handling in Emacs.

          #+NAME: with-rownames
          | one | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |
          | two | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=with-rownames :rownames yes
            return [[val + 10 for val in row] for row in tab]
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          | one | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
          | two | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |

list
     A simple named list.

          #+NAME: example-list
          - simple
            - not
            - nested
          - list

          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=example-list
            (print x)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          | simple | list |

     Note that only the top level list items are passed along.  Nested
     list items are ignored.

code block without arguments
     A code block name, as assigned by ‘NAME’ keyword from the example
     above, optionally followed by parentheses.

          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var length=table-length()
            (* 2 length)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : 8

code block with arguments
     A code block name, as assigned by ‘NAME’ keyword, followed by
     parentheses and optional arguments passed within the parentheses.

          #+NAME: double
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=8
            (* 2 input)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: double
          : 16

          #+NAME: squared
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=double(input=1)
            (* input input)
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: squared
          : 4

literal example
     A literal example block named with a ‘NAME’ keyword.

          #+NAME: literal-example
          #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
            A literal example
            on two lines
          #+END_EXAMPLE

          #+NAME: read-literal-example
          #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=literal-example
            (concatenate #'string x " for you.")
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: read-literal-example
          : A literal example
          : on two lines for you.

   Indexing variable values enables referencing portions of a variable.
Indexes are 0 based with negative values counting backwards from the
end.  If an index is separated by commas then each subsequent section
indexes as the next dimension.  Note that this indexing occurs _before_
other table-related header arguments are applied, such as ‘hlines’,
‘colnames’ and ‘rownames’.  The following example assigns the last cell
of the first row the table ‘example-table’ to the variable ‘data’:

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[0,-1]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : a

   Two integers separated by a colon reference a range of variable
values.  In that case the entire inclusive range is referenced.  For
example the following assigns the middle three rows of ‘example-table’
to ‘data’.

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |
     | 5 | 3 |

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[1:3]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |

   To pick the entire range, use an empty index, or the single character
‘*’.  ‘0:-1’ does the same thing.  Example below shows how to reference
the first column only.

     #+NAME: example-table
     | 1 | a |
     | 2 | b |
     | 3 | c |
     | 4 | d |

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[,0]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

   Index referencing can be used for tables and code blocks.  Index
referencing can handle any number of dimensions.  Commas delimit
multiple dimensions, as shown below.

     #+NAME: 3D
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       '(((1  2  3)  (4  5  6)  (7  8  9))
         ((10 11 12) (13 14 15) (16 17 18))
         ((19 20 21) (22 23 24) (25 26 27)))
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=3D[1,,1]
       data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     | 11 | 14 | 17 |

   Note that row names and column names are not removed prior to
variable indexing.  You need to take them into account, even when
‘colnames’ or ‘rownames’ header arguments remove them.

   Emacs lisp code can also set the values for variables.  To
differentiate a value from Lisp code, Org interprets any value starting
with ‘(’, ‘[’, ‘'’ or ‘`’ as Emacs Lisp code.  The result of evaluating
that code is then assigned to the value of that variable.  The following
example shows how to reliably query and pass the file name of the Org
mode buffer to a code block using headers.  We need reliability here
because the file’s name could change once the code in the block starts
executing.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var filename=(buffer-file-name) :exports both
       wc -w $filename
     #+END_SRC

   Note that values read from tables and lists are not mistakenly
evaluated as Emacs Lisp code, as illustrated in the following example.

     #+NAME: table
     | (a b c) |

     #+HEADER: :var data=table[0,0]
     #+BEGIN_SRC perl
       $data
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : (a b c)

Using sessions
--------------

Two code blocks can share the same environment.  The ‘session’ header
argument is for running multiple source code blocks under one session.
Org runs code blocks with the same session name in the same interpreter
process.

‘none’
     Default.  Each code block gets a new interpreter process to
     execute.  The process terminates once the block is evaluated.

STRING
     Any string besides ‘none’ turns that string into the name of that
     session.  For example, ‘:session STRING’ names it ‘STRING’.  If
     ‘session’ has no value, then the session name is derived from the
     source language identifier.  Subsequent blocks with the same source
     code language use the same session.  Depending on the language,
     state variables, code from other blocks, and the overall
     interpreted environment may be shared.  Some interpreted languages
     support concurrent sessions when subsequent source code language
     blocks change session names.

   Only languages that provide interactive evaluation can have session
support.  Not all languages provide this support, such as C and ditaa.
Even languages, such as Python and Haskell, that do support interactive
evaluation impose limitations on allowable language constructs that can
run interactively.  Org inherits those limitations for those code blocks
running in a session.

Choosing a working directory
----------------------------

The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code
block execution.  If it is absent, then the directory associated with
the current buffer is used.  In other words, supplying ‘:dir PATH’
temporarily has the same effect as changing the current directory with
‘M-x cd PATH’, and then not setting ‘dir’.  Under the surface, ‘dir’
simply sets the value of the Emacs variable ‘default-directory’.

   For example, to save the plot file in the ‘Work/’ folder of the home
directory—notice tilde is expanded:

     #+BEGIN_SRC R :file myplot.png :dir ~/Work
       matplot(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), type="l")
     #+END_SRC

   To evaluate the code block on a remote machine, supply a remote
directory name using Tramp syntax.  For example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC R :file plot.png :dir /scp:dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:
       plot(1:10, main=system("hostname", intern=TRUE))
     #+END_SRC

   Org first captures the text results as usual for insertion in the Org
file.  Then Org also inserts a link to the remote file, thanks to Emacs
Tramp.  Org constructs the remote path to the file name from ‘dir’ and
‘default-directory’, as illustrated here:

     [[file:/scp:dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:/home/dand/plot.png][plot.png]]

   When ‘dir’ is used with ‘session’, Org sets the starting directory
for a new session.  But Org does not alter the directory of an already
existing session.

   Do not use ‘dir’ with ‘:exports results’ or with ‘:exports both’ to
avoid Org inserting incorrect links to remote files.  That is because
Org does not expand ‘default directory’ to avoid some underlying
portability issues.

Inserting headers and footers
-----------------------------

The ‘prologue’ header argument is for appending to the top of the code
block for execution, like a reset instruction.  For example, you may use
‘:prologue "reset"’ in a Gnuplot code block or, for every such block:

     (add-to-list 'org-babel-default-header-args:gnuplot
                  '((:prologue . "reset")))


   Likewise, the value of the ‘epilogue’ header argument is for
appending to the end of the code block for execution.

14.4 Evaluating Code Blocks
===========================

A note about security: With code evaluation comes the risk of harm.  Org
safeguards by prompting for user’s permission before executing any code
in the source block.  To customize this safeguard, or disable it, see
*note Code Evaluation Security::.

How to evaluate source code
---------------------------

Org captures the results of the code block evaluation and inserts them
in the Org file, right after the code block.  The insertion point is
after a newline and the ‘RESULTS’ keyword.  Org creates the ‘RESULTS’
keyword if one is not already there.

   By default, Org enables only Emacs Lisp code blocks for execution.
See *note Languages:: to enable other languages.

   Org provides many ways to execute code blocks.  ‘C-c C-c’ or ‘C-c C-v
e’ with the point on a code block(1) calls the
‘org-babel-execute-src-block’ function, which executes the code in the
block, collects the results, and inserts them in the buffer.

   By calling a named code block(2) from an Org mode buffer or a table.
Org can call the named code blocks from the current Org mode buffer or
from the “Library of Babel” (see *note Library of Babel::).

   The syntax for ‘CALL’ keyword is:

     #+CALL: <name>(<arguments>)
     #+CALL: <name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>) <end header arguments>

   The syntax for inline named code blocks is:

     ... call_<name>(<arguments>) ...
     ... call_<name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>)[<end header arguments>] ...

   When inline syntax is used, the result is wrapped based on the
variable ‘org-babel-inline-result-wrap’, which by default is set to
‘"=%s="’ to produce verbatim text suitable for markup.

‘<name>’
     This is the name of the code block (see *note Structure of Code
     Blocks::) to be evaluated in the current document.  If the block is
     located in another file, start ‘<name>’ with the file name followed
     by a colon.  For example, in order to execute a block named
     ‘clear-data’ in ‘file.org’, you can write the following:

          #+CALL: file.org:clear-data()

‘<arguments>’
     Org passes arguments to the code block using standard function call
     syntax.  For example, a ‘#+CALL:’ line that passes ‘4’ to a code
     block named ‘double’, which declares the header argument ‘:var
     n=2’, would be written as:

          #+CALL: double(n=4)

     Note how this function call syntax is different from the header
     argument syntax.

‘<inside header arguments>’
     Org passes inside header arguments to the named code block using
     the header argument syntax.  Inside header arguments apply to code
     block evaluation.  For example, ‘[:results output]’ collects
     results printed to stdout during code execution of that block.
     Note how this header argument syntax is different from the function
     call syntax.

‘<end header arguments>’
     End header arguments affect the results returned by the code block.
     For example, ‘:results html’ wraps the results in a ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT
     html’ block before inserting the results in the Org buffer.

Limit code block evaluation
---------------------------

The ‘eval’ header argument can limit evaluation of specific code blocks
and ‘CALL’ keyword.  It is useful for protection against evaluating
untrusted code blocks by prompting for a confirmation.

‘never’ or ‘no’
     Org never evaluates the source code.

‘query’
     Org prompts the user for permission to evaluate the source code.

‘never-export’ or ‘no-export’
     Org does not evaluate the source code when exporting, yet the user
     can evaluate it interactively.

‘query-export’
     Org prompts the user for permission to evaluate the source code
     during export.

   If ‘eval’ header argument is not set, then Org determines whether to
evaluate the source code from the ‘org-confirm-babel-evaluate’ variable
(see *note Code Evaluation Security::).

Cache results of evaluation
---------------------------

The ‘cache’ header argument is for caching results of evaluating code
blocks.  Caching results can avoid re-evaluating a code block that have
not changed since the previous run.  To benefit from the cache and avoid
redundant evaluations, the source block must have a result already
present in the buffer, and neither the header arguments—including the
value of ‘var’ references—nor the text of the block itself has changed
since the result was last computed.  This feature greatly helps avoid
long-running calculations.  For some edge cases, however, the cached
results may not be reliable.

   The caching feature is best for when code blocks are pure functions,
that is functions that return the same value for the same input
arguments (see *note Environment of a Code Block::), and that do not
have side effects, and do not rely on external variables other than the
input arguments.  Functions that depend on a timer, file system objects,
and random number generators are clearly unsuitable for caching.

   A note of warning: when ‘cache’ is used in a session, caching may
cause unexpected results.

   When the caching mechanism tests for any source code changes, it does
not expand Noweb style references (see *note Noweb Reference Syntax::).
For reasons why, see
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/79046>.

   The ‘cache’ header argument can have one of two values: ‘yes’ or
‘no’.

‘no’
     Default.  No caching of results; code block evaluated every time.

‘yes’
     Whether to run the code or return the cached results is determined
     by comparing the SHA1 hash value of the combined code block and
     arguments passed to it.  This hash value is packed on the
     ‘#+RESULTS:’ line from previous evaluation.  When hash values
     match, Org does not evaluate the code block.  When hash values
     mismatch, Org evaluates the code block, inserts the results,
     recalculates the hash value, and updates ‘#+RESULTS:’ line.

   In this example, both functions are cached.  But ‘caller’ runs only
if the result from ‘random’ has changed since the last run.

     #+NAME: random
     #+BEGIN_SRC R :cache yes
       runif(1)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS[a2a72cd647ad44515fab62e144796432793d68e1]: random
     0.4659510825295

     #+NAME: caller
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=random :cache yes
       x
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS[bec9c8724e397d5df3b696502df3ed7892fc4f5f]: caller
     0.254227238707244

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The option ‘org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c’ can be used to
remove code evaluation from the ‘C-c C-c’ key binding.

   (2) Actually, the constructs ‘call_<name>()’ and ‘src_<lang>{}’ are
not evaluated when they appear in a keyword (see *note In-buffer
Settings::).

14.5 Results of Evaluation
==========================

How Org handles results of a code block execution depends on many header
arguments working together.  The primary determinant, however, is the
‘results’ header argument.  It accepts four classes of options.  Each
code block can take only one option per class:

collection
     For how the results should be collected from the code block;

type
     For which type of result the code block will return; affects how
     Org processes and inserts results in the Org buffer;

format
     For the result; affects how Org processes and inserts results in
     the Org buffer;

handling
     For processing results after evaluation of the code block;

Collection
----------

Collection options specify the results.  Choose one of the options; they
are mutually exclusive.

‘value’
     Default.  Functional mode.  Org gets the value by wrapping the code
     in a function definition in the language of the source block.  That
     is why when using ‘:results value’, code should execute like a
     function and return a value.  For languages like Python, an
     explicit ‘return’ statement is mandatory when using ‘:results
     value’.  Result is the value returned by the last statement in the
     code block.

     When evaluating the code block in a session (see *note Environment
     of a Code Block::), Org passes the code to an interpreter running
     as an interactive Emacs inferior process.  Org gets the value from
     the source code interpreter’s last statement output.  Org has to
     use language-specific methods to obtain the value.  For example,
     from the variable ‘_’ in Python and Ruby, and the value of
     ‘.Last.value’ in R.

‘output’
     Scripting mode.  Org passes the code to an external process running
     the interpreter.  Org returns the contents of the standard output
     stream as text results.

     When using a session, Org passes the code to the interpreter
     running as an interactive Emacs inferior process.  Org concatenates
     any text output from the interpreter and returns the collection as
     a result.

     Note that this collection is not the same as that would be
     collected from stdout of a non-interactive interpreter running as
     an external process.  Compare for example these two blocks:

          #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
            print "hello"
            2
            print "bye"
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : hello
          : bye

     In the above non-session mode, the “2” is not printed; so it does
     not appear in results.

          #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
            print "hello"
            2
            print "bye"
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : hello
          : 2
          : bye

     In the above session, the interactive interpreter receives and
     prints “2”.  Results show that.

Type
----

Type tells what result types to expect from the execution of the code
block.  Choose one of the options; they are mutually exclusive.  The
default behavior is to automatically determine the result type.

‘table’
‘vector’
     Interpret the results as an Org table.  If the result is a single
     value, create a table with one row and one column.  Usage example:
     ‘:results value table’.

     In-between each table row or below the table headings, sometimes
     results have horizontal lines, which are also known as “hlines”.
     The ‘hlines’ argument with the default ‘no’ value strips such lines
     from the input table.  For most code, this is desirable, or else
     those ‘hline’ symbols raise unbound variable errors.  A ‘yes’
     accepts such lines, as demonstrated in the following example.

          #+NAME: many-cols
          | a | b | c |
          |---+---+---|
          | d | e | f |
          |---+---+---|
          | g | h | i |

          #+NAME: no-hline
          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols :hlines no
            return tab
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: no-hline
          | a | b | c |
          | d | e | f |
          | g | h | i |

          #+NAME: hlines
          #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols :hlines yes
            return tab
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS: hlines
          | a | b | c |
          |---+---+---|
          | d | e | f |
          |---+---+---|
          | g | h | i |

‘list’
     Interpret the results as an Org list.  If the result is a single
     value, create a list of one element.

‘scalar’
‘verbatim’
     Interpret literally and insert as quoted text.  Do not create a
     table.  Usage example: ‘:results value verbatim’.

‘file’
     Interpret as a filename.  Save the results of execution of the code
     block to that file, then insert a link to it.  You can control both
     the filename and the description associated to the link.

     Org first tries to generate the filename from the value of the
     ‘file’ header argument and the directory specified using the
     ‘output-dir’ header arguments.  If ‘output-dir’ is not specified,
     Org assumes it is the current directory.

          #+BEGIN_SRC asymptote :results value file :file circle.pdf :output-dir img/
            size(2cm);
            draw(unitcircle);
          #+END_SRC

     If ‘file’ is missing, Org generates the base name of the output
     file from the name of the code block, and its extension from the
     ‘file-ext’ header argument.  In that case, both the name and the
     extension are mandatory(1).

          #+name: circle
          #+BEGIN_SRC asymptote :results value file :file-ext pdf
            size(2cm);
            draw(unitcircle);
          #+END_SRC

     The ‘file-desc’ header argument defines the description (see *note
     Link Format::) for the link.  If ‘file-desc’ has no value, Org uses
     the generated file name for both the “link” and “description” parts
     of the link.

     By default, Org assumes that a table written to a file has
     TAB-delimited output.  You can choose a different separator with
     the ‘sep’ header argument.

Format
------

Format pertains to the type of the result returned by the code block.
Choose one of the options; they are mutually exclusive.  The default
follows from the type specified above.

‘code’
     Result enclosed in a code block.  Useful for parsing.  Usage
     example: ‘:results value code’.

‘drawer’
     Result wrapped in a ‘RESULTS’ drawer.  Useful for containing ‘raw’
     or ‘org’ results for later scripting and automated processing.
     Usage example: ‘:results value drawer’.

‘html’
     Results enclosed in a ‘BEGIN_EXPORT html’ block.  Usage example:
     ‘:results value html’.

‘latex’
     Results enclosed in a ‘BEGIN_EXPORT latex’ block.  Usage example:
     ‘:results value latex’.

‘link’
‘graphics’
     Result is a link to the file specified in ‘:file’ header argument.
     However, unlike plain ‘:file’, nothing is written to the disk.  The
     block is used for its side-effects only, as in the following
     example:

          #+begin_src shell :results link :file "download.tar.gz"
          wget -c "http://example.com/download.tar.gz"
          #+end_src

‘org’
     Results enclosed in a ‘BEGIN_SRC org’ block.  For comma-escape,
     either ‘<TAB>’ in the block, or export the file.  Usage example:
     ‘:results value org’.

‘pp’
     Result converted to pretty-print source code.  Enclosed in a code
     block.  Languages supported: Emacs Lisp, Python, and Ruby.  Usage
     example: ‘:results value pp’.

‘raw’
     Interpreted as raw Org mode.  Inserted directly into the buffer.
     Aligned if it is a table.  Usage example: ‘:results value raw’.

   The ‘wrap’ header argument unconditionnally marks the results block
by appending strings to ‘#+BEGIN_’ and ‘#+END_’.  If no string is
specified, Org wraps the results in a ‘#+BEGIN_results’ ...
‘#+END_results’ block.  It takes precedent over the ‘results’ value
listed above.  E.g.,

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results html :wrap EXPORT markdown
     "<blink>Welcome back to the 90's</blink>"
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     #+BEGIN_EXPORT markdown
     <blink>Welcome back to the 90's</blink>
     #+END_EXPORT

Handling
--------

Handling options after collecting the results.

‘silent’
     Do not insert results in the Org mode buffer, but echo them in the
     minibuffer.  Usage example: ‘:results output silent’.

‘replace’
     Default.  Insert results in the Org buffer.  Remove previous
     results.  Usage example: ‘:results output replace’.

‘append’
     Append results to the Org buffer.  Latest results are at the
     bottom.  Does not remove previous results.  Usage example:
     ‘:results output append’.

‘prepend’
     Prepend results to the Org buffer.  Latest results are at the top.
     Does not remove previous results.  Usage example: ‘:results output
     prepend’.

Post-processing
---------------

The ‘post’ header argument is for post-processing results from block
evaluation.  When ‘post’ has any value, Org binds the results to
‘*this*’ variable for easy passing to ‘var’ header argument
specifications (see *note Environment of a Code Block::).  That makes
results available to other code blocks, or even for direct Emacs Lisp
code execution.

   The following two examples illustrate ‘post’ header argument in
action.  The first one shows how to attach an ‘ATTR_LATEX’ keyword using
‘post’.

     #+NAME: attr_wrap
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var data="" :var width="\\textwidth" :results output
       echo "#+ATTR_LATEX: :width $width"
       echo "$data"
     #+END_SRC

     #+HEADER: :file /tmp/it.png
     #+BEGIN_SRC dot :post attr_wrap(width="5cm", data=*this*) :results drawer
       digraph{
               a -> b;
               b -> c;
               c -> a;
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :RESULTS:
     #+ATTR_LATEX :width 5cm
     [[file:/tmp/it.png]]
     :END:

   The second example shows use of ‘colnames’ header argument in ‘post’
to pass data between code blocks.

     #+NAME: round-tbl
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var tbl="" fmt="%.3f"
       (mapcar (lambda (row)
                 (mapcar (lambda (cell)
                           (if (numberp cell)
                               (format fmt cell)
                             cell))
                         row))
               tbl)
     #+end_src

     #+BEGIN_SRC R :colnames yes :post round-tbl[:colnames yes](*this*)
       set.seed(42)
       data.frame(foo=rnorm(1))
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     |   foo |
     |-------|
     | 1.371 |

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Due to the way this header argument is implemented, it implies
“:results file”.  Therefore if it is set for multiple blocks at once (by
a subtree or buffer property for example), all blocks are forced to
produce file results.  This is seldom desired behavior, so it is
recommended to set this header only on a per-block basis.  It is
possible that this aspect of the implementation might change in the
future.

14.6 Exporting Code Blocks
==========================

It is possible to export the _code_ of code blocks, the _results_ of
code block evaluation, _both_ the code and the results of code block
evaluation, or _none_.  Org defaults to exporting _code_ for most
languages.  For some languages, such as ditaa, Org defaults to
_results_.  To export just the body of code blocks, see *note Literal
Examples::.  To selectively export sub-trees of an Org document, see
*note Exporting::.

   The ‘exports’ header argument is to specify if that part of the Org
file is exported to, say, HTML or LaTeX formats.

‘code’
     The default.  The body of code is included into the exported file.
     Example: ‘:exports code’.

‘results’
     The results of evaluation of the code is included in the exported
     file.  Example: ‘:exports results’.

‘both’
     Both the code and results of evaluation are included in the
     exported file.  Example: ‘:exports both’.

‘none’
     Neither the code nor the results of evaluation is included in the
     exported file.  Whether the code is evaluated at all depends on
     other options.  Example: ‘:exports none’.

   To stop Org from evaluating code blocks to speed exports, use the
header argument ‘:eval never-export’ (see *note Evaluating Code
Blocks::).  To stop Org from evaluating code blocks for greater
security, set the ‘org-export-use-babel’ variable to ‘nil’, but
understand that header arguments will have no effect.

   Turning off evaluation comes in handy when batch processing.  For
example, markup languages for wikis, which have a high risk of untrusted
code.  Stopping code block evaluation also stops evaluation of all
header arguments of the code block.  This may not be desirable in some
circumstances.  So during export, to allow evaluation of just the header
arguments but not any code evaluation in the source block, set ‘:eval
never-export’ (see *note Evaluating Code Blocks::).

   Org never evaluates code blocks in commented sub-trees when exporting
(see *note Comment Lines::).  On the other hand, Org does evaluate code
blocks in sub-trees excluded from export (see *note Export Settings::).

14.7 Extracting Source Code
===========================

Extracting source code from code blocks is a basic task in literate
programming.  Org has features to make this easy.  In literate
programming parlance, documents on creation are _woven_ with code and
documentation, and on export, the code is tangled for execution by a
computer.  Org facilitates weaving and tangling for producing,
maintaining, sharing, and exporting literate programming documents.  Org
provides extensive customization options for extracting source code.

   When Org tangles code blocks, it expands, merges, and transforms
them.  Then Org recomposes them into one or more separate files, as
configured through the options.  During this tangling process, Org
expands variables in the source code, and resolves any Noweb style
references (see *note Noweb Reference Syntax::).

Header arguments
----------------

The ‘tangle’ header argument specifies if the code block is exported to
source file(s).

‘yes’
     Export the code block to source file.  The file name for the source
     file is derived from the name of the Org file, and the file
     extension is derived from the source code language identifier.
     Example: ‘:tangle yes’.

‘no’
     The default.  Do not extract the code in a source code file.
     Example: ‘:tangle no’.

FILENAME
     Export the code block to source file whose file name is derived
     from any string passed to the ‘tangle’ header argument.  Org
     derives the file name as being relative to the directory of the Org
     file’s location.  Example: ‘:tangle FILENAME’.

   The ‘mkdirp’ header argument creates parent directories for tangled
files if the directory does not exist.  ‘yes’ enables directory creation
and ‘no’ inhibits directory creation.

   The ‘comments’ header argument controls inserting comments into
tangled files.  These are above and beyond whatever comments may already
exist in the code block.

‘no’
     The default.  Do not insert any extra comments during tangling.

‘link’
     Wrap the code block in comments.  Include links pointing back to
     the place in the Org file from where the code was tangled.

‘yes’
     Kept for backward compatibility; same as ‘link’.

‘org’
     Nearest headline text from Org file is inserted as comment.  The
     exact text that is inserted is picked from the leading context of
     the source block.

‘both’
     Includes both ‘link’ and ‘org’ options.

‘noweb’
     Includes ‘link’ option, expands Noweb references (see *note Noweb
     Reference Syntax::), and wraps them in link comments inside the
     body of the code block.

   The ‘padline’ header argument controls insertion of newlines to pad
source code in the tangled file.

‘yes’
     Default.  Insert a newline before and after each code block in the
     tangled file.

‘no’
     Do not insert newlines to pad the tangled code blocks.

   The ‘shebang’ header argument can turn results into executable script
files.  By setting it to a string value—for example, ‘:shebang
"#!/bin/bash"’—Org inserts that string as the first line of the tangled
file that the code block is extracted to.  Org then turns on the tangled
file’s executable permission.

   The ‘tangle-mode’ header argument specifies what permissions to set
for tangled files by ‘set-file-modes’.  For example, to make a read-only
tangled file, use ‘:tangle-mode (identity #o444)’.  To make it
executable, use ‘:tangle-mode (identity #o755)’.  It also overrides
executable permission granted by ‘shebang’.  When multiple source code
blocks tangle to a single file with different and conflicting
‘tangle-mode’ header arguments, Org’s behavior is undefined.

   By default Org expands code blocks during tangling.  The ‘no-expand’
header argument turns off such expansions.  Note that one side-effect of
expansion by ‘org-babel-expand-src-block’ also assigns values (see *note
Environment of a Code Block::) to variables.  Expansions also replace
Noweb references with their targets (see *note Noweb Reference
Syntax::).  Some of these expansions may cause premature assignment,
hence this option.  This option makes a difference only for tangling.
It has no effect when exporting since code blocks for execution have to
be expanded anyway.

Functions
---------

‘org-babel-tangle’
     Tangle the current file.  Bound to ‘C-c C-v t’.

     With prefix argument only tangle the current code block.

‘org-babel-tangle-file’
     Choose a file to tangle.  Bound to ‘C-c C-v f’.

Hooks
-----

‘org-babel-post-tangle-hook’
     This hook is run from within code files tangled by
     ‘org-babel-tangle’, making it suitable for post-processing,
     compilation, and evaluation of code in the tangled files.

Jumping between code and Org
----------------------------

Debuggers normally link errors and messages back to the source code.
But for tangled files, we want to link back to the Org file, not to the
tangled source file.  To make this extra jump, Org uses
‘org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org’ function with two additional source code
block header arguments:

  1. Set ‘padline’ to true—this is the default setting.
  2. Set ‘comments’ to ‘link’, which makes Org insert links to the Org
     file.

Lisp           ‘lisp’

   Additional documentation for some languages is at
<https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html>.

   By default, only Emacs Lisp is enabled for evaluation.  To enable or
disable other languages, customize the ‘org-babel-load-languages’
variable either through the Emacs customization interface, or by adding
code to the init file as shown next.

   In this example, evaluation is disabled for Emacs Lisp, and enabled
for R.

     (org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages
      '((emacs-lisp . nil)
        (R . t)))

   Note that this is not the only way to enable a language.  Org also
enables languages when loaded with ‘require’ statement.  For example,
the following enables execution of Clojure code blocks:

     (require 'ob-clojure)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) C++ language is handled in ‘ob-C.el’.  Even though the identifier
for such source blocks is ‘C++’, you activate it by loading the C
language.

   (2) D language is handled in ‘ob-C.el’.  Even though the identifier
for such source blocks is ‘D’, you activate it by loading the C
language.


File: org,  Node: Editing Source Code,  Next: Noweb Reference Syntax,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Working with Source Code

14.9 Editing Source Code
========================

Use ‘C-c '’ to edit the current code block.  It opens a new major-mode
edit buffer containing the body of the source code block, ready for any
edits.  Use ‘C-c '’ again to close the buffer and return to the Org
buffer.

   ‘C-x C-s’ saves the buffer and updates the contents of the Org
buffer.  Set ‘org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay’ to save the base buffer
after a certain idle delay time.  Set ‘org-edit-src-turn-on-auto-save’
to auto-save this buffer into a separate file using Auto-save mode.

   While editing the source code in the major mode, the Org Src minor
mode remains active.  It provides these customization variables as
described below.  For even more variables, look in the customization
group ‘org-edit-structure’.

‘org-src-lang-modes’
     If an Emacs major-mode named ‘<LANG>-mode’ exists, where <LANG> is
     the language identifier from code block’s header line, then the
     edit buffer uses that major mode.  Use this variable to arbitrarily
     map language identifiers to major modes.

‘org-src-window-setup’
     For specifying Emacs window arrangement when the new edit buffer is
     created.

‘org-src-preserve-indentation’
     Default is ‘nil’.  Source code is indented.  This indentation
     applies during export or tangling, and depending on the context,
     may alter leading spaces and tabs.  When non-‘nil’, source code is
     aligned with the leftmost column.  No lines are modified during
     export or tangling, which is very useful for white-space sensitive
     languages, such as Python.

‘org-src-ask-before-returning-to-edit-buffer’
     When ‘nil’, Org returns to the edit buffer without further prompts.
     The default prompts for a confirmation.

   Set ‘org-src-fontify-natively’ to non-‘nil’ to turn on native code
fontification in the _Org_ buffer.  Fontification of code blocks can
give visual separation of text and code on the display page.  To further
customize the appearance of ‘org-block’ for specific languages,
customize ‘org-src-block-faces’.  The following example shades the
background of regular blocks, and colors source blocks only for Python
and Emacs Lisp languages.

     (require 'color)
     (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :background
                         (color-darken-name
                          (face-attribute 'default :background) 3))

     (setq org-src-block-faces '(("emacs-lisp" (:background "#EEE2FF"))
                                 ("python" (:background "#E5FFB8"))))


File: org,  Node: Noweb Reference Syntax,  Next: Library of Babel,  Prev: Editing Source Code,  Up: Working with Source Code

14.10 Noweb Reference Syntax
============================

Org supports named blocks in Noweb(1) style syntax:

     <<CODE-BLOCK-ID>>

   Org can replace the construct with the source code, or the results of
evaluation, of the code block identified as CODE-BLOCK-ID.

   The ‘noweb’ header argument controls expansion of Noweb syntax
references.  Expansions occur when source code blocks are evaluated,
tangled, or exported.

‘no’
     Default.  No expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of
     the code when evaluating, tangling, or exporting.

‘yes’
     Expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of the code block
     when evaluating, tangling, or exporting.

‘tangle’
     Expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of the code block
     when tangling.  No expansion when evaluating or exporting.

‘no-export’
     Expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of the code block
     when evaluating or tangling.  No expansion when exporting.

‘strip-export’
     Expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of the code block
     when expanding prior to evaluating or tangling.  Removes Noweb
     syntax references when exporting.

‘eval’
     Expansion of Noweb syntax references in the body of the code block
     only before evaluating.

   In the following example,

     #+NAME: initialization
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq sentence "Never a foot too far, even.")
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes
       <<initialization>>
       (reverse sentence)
     #+END_SRC

the second code block is expanded as

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes
       (setq sentence "Never a foot too far, even.")
       (reverse sentence)
     #+END_SRC

   Noweb insertions honor prefix characters that appear before the Noweb
syntax reference.  This behavior is illustrated in the following
example.  Because the ‘<<example>>’ Noweb reference appears behind the
SQL comment syntax, each line of the expanded Noweb reference is
commented.  With:

     #+NAME: example
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       this is the
       multi-line body of example
     #+END_SRC

this code block:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sql :noweb yes
      ---<<example>>
     #+END_SRC

expands to:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sql :noweb yes
      ---this is the
      ---multi-line body of example
     #+END_SRC

   Since this change does not affect Noweb replacement text without
newlines in them, inline Noweb references are acceptable.

   This feature can also be used for management of indentation in
exported code snippets.  With:

     #+NAME: if-true
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none
       print('do things when true')
     #+end_src

     #+name: if-false
     #+begin_src python :exports none
       print('do things when false')
     #+end_src

this code block:

     #+begin_src python :noweb yes :results output
       if true:
           <<if-true>>
       else:
           <<if-false>>
     #+end_src

expands to:

     if true:
         print('do things when true')
     else:
         print('do things when false')

   When expanding Noweb style references, Org concatenates code blocks
by matching the reference name to either the code block name or, if none
is found, to the ‘noweb-ref’ header argument.

   For simple concatenation, set this ‘noweb-ref’ header argument at the
sub-tree or file level.  In the example Org file shown next, the body of
the source code in each block is extracted for concatenation to a pure
code file when tangled.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle yes :noweb yes :shebang #!/bin/sh
       <<fullest-disk>>
     #+END_SRC
     * the mount point of the fullest disk
       :PROPERTIES:
       :header-args: :noweb-ref fullest-disk
       :END:

     ** query all mounted disks
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       df \
     #+END_SRC

     ** strip the header row
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       |sed '1d' \
     #+END_SRC

     ** output mount point of fullest disk
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       |awk '{if (u < +$5) {u = +$5; m = $6}} END {print m}'
     #+END_SRC

   By default a newline separates each noweb reference concatenation.
To change this newline separator, edit the ‘noweb-sep’ header argument.

   Eventually, Org can include the results of a code block rather than
its body.  To that effect, append parentheses, possibly including
arguments, to the code block name, as shown below.

     <<code-block-name(optional arguments)>>

   Note that when using the above approach to a code block’s results,
the code block name set by ‘NAME’ keyword is required; the reference set
by ‘noweb-ref’ does not work in that case.

   Here is an example that demonstrates how the exported content changes
when Noweb style references are used with parentheses versus without.
With:

     #+NAME: some-code
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :var num=0 :results output :exports none
       print(num*10)
     #+END_SRC

this code block:

     #+BEGIN_SRC text :noweb yes
       <<some-code>>
     #+END_SRC

expands to:

     print(num*10)

   Below, a similar Noweb style reference is used, but with parentheses,
while setting a variable ‘num’ to 10:

     #+BEGIN_SRC text :noweb yes
       <<some-code(num=10)>>
     #+END_SRC

Note that now the expansion contains the results of the code block
‘some-code’, not the code block itself:

     100

15.1 Completion
===============

Org has in-buffer completions.  Unlike minibuffer completions, which are
useful for quick command interactions, Org’s in-buffer completions are
more suitable for content creation in Org documents.  Type one or more
letters and invoke the hot key to complete the text in-place.  Depending
on the context and the keys, Org offers different types of completions.
No minibuffer is involved.  Such mode-specific hot keys have become an
integral part of Emacs and Org provides several shortcuts.

‘M-<TAB>’

     Complete word at point.

        • At the beginning of a headline, complete TODO keywords.

        • After ‘\’, complete TeX symbols supported by the exporter.

        • After ‘*’, complete headlines in the current buffer so that
          they can be used in search links like:

               [[*find this headline]]

        • After ‘:’ in a headline, complete tags.  Org deduces the list
          of tags from the ‘TAGS’ in-buffer option (see *note Setting
          Tags::), the variable ‘org-tag-alist’, or from all tags used
          in the current buffer.

        • After ‘:’ and not in a headline, complete property keys.  The
          list of keys is constructed dynamically from all keys used in
          the current buffer.

        • After ‘[’, complete link abbreviations (see *note Link
          Abbreviations::).

        • After ‘#+’, complete the special keywords like ‘TYP_TODO’ or
          file-specific ‘OPTIONS’.  After option keyword is complete,
          pressing ‘M-<TAB>’ again inserts example settings for this
          keyword.

        • After ‘STARTUP’ keyword, complete startup items.

        • When point is anywhere else, complete dictionary words using
          Ispell.

15.2 Structure Templates
========================

With just a few keystrokes, it is possible to insert empty structural
blocks, such as ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ ... ‘#+END_SRC’, or to wrap existing text
in such a block.

‘C-c C-,’ (‘org-insert-structure-template’)
     Prompt for a type of block structure, and insert the block at
     point.  If the region is active, it is wrapped in the block.  First
     prompts the user for keys, which are used to look up a structure
     type from the variable below.  If the key is ‘<TAB>’, ‘<RET>’, or
     ‘<SPC>’, the user is prompted to enter a block type.

   Available structure types are defined in
‘org-structure-template-alist’, see the docstring for adding or changing
values.

   Org Tempo expands snippets to structures defined in
‘org-structure-template-alist’ and ‘org-tempo-keywords-alist’.  For
example, ‘< s <TAB>’ creates a code block.  Enable it by customizing
‘org-modules’ or add ‘(require 'org-tempo)’ to your Emacs init file(1).

‘a’     ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT ascii’ ... ‘#+END_EXPORT’
‘c’     ‘#+BEGIN_CENTER’ ... ‘#+END_CENTER’
‘C’     ‘#+BEGIN_COMMENT’ ... ‘#+END_COMMENT’
‘e’     ‘#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE’ ... ‘#+END_EXAMPLE’
‘E’     ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT’ ... ‘#+END_EXPORT’
‘h’     ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT html’ ... ‘#+END_EXPORT’
‘l’     ‘#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex’ ... ‘#+END_EXPORT’
‘q’     ‘#+BEGIN_QUOTE’ ... ‘#+END_QUOTE’
‘s’     ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ ... ‘#+END_SRC’
‘v’     ‘#+BEGIN_VERSE’ ... ‘#+END_VERSE’

15.3 Escape Character
=====================

You may sometimes want to write text that looks like Org syntax, but
should really read as plain text.  Org may use a specific escape
character in some situations, e.g., a backslash in macros (see *note
Macro Replacement::).  In the general case, however, we suggest to use
the zero width space.  You can get it with one of the following:

     C-x 8 <RET> zero width space <RET>
     C-x 8 <RET> 200B <RET>

   For example, in order to write ‘[[1,2]]’ as-is in your document, you
can write this, where ‘X’ denotes the zero width space character:

     [[X1,2]]

15.4 Speed Keys
===============

Single keystrokes can execute custom commands in an Org file when point
is on a headline.  Without the extra burden of a meta or modifier key,
Speed Keys can speed navigation or execute custom commands.  Besides
faster navigation, Speed Keys may come in handy on small mobile devices
that do not have full keyboards.  Speed Keys may also work on TTY
devices known for their problems when entering Emacs key chords.

   By default, Org has Speed Keys disabled.  To activate Speed Keys, set
the variable ‘org-use-speed-commands’ to a non-‘nil’ value.  To trigger
a Speed Key, point must be at the beginning of an Org headline, before
any of the stars.

   Org comes with a pre-defined list of Speed Keys.  To add or modify
Speed Keys, customize the variable, ‘org-speed-commands-user’.  For more
details, see the variable’s docstring.  With Speed Keys activated, ‘M-x
org-speed-command-help’, or ‘?’ when point is at the beginning of an Org
headline, shows currently active Speed Keys, including the user-defined
ones.

15.5 Code Evaluation and Security Issues
========================================

Unlike plain text, running code comes with risk.  Each source code
block, in terms of risk, is equivalent to an executable file.  Org
therefore puts a few confirmation prompts by default.  This is to alert
the casual user from accidentally running untrusted code.

   For users who do not run code blocks or write code regularly, Org’s
default settings should suffice.  However, some users may want to tweak
the prompts for fewer interruptions.  To weigh the risks of automatic
execution of code blocks, here are some details about code evaluation.

   Org evaluates code in the following circumstances:

_Source code blocks_
     Org evaluates source code blocks in an Org file during export.  Org
     also evaluates a source code block with the ‘C-c C-c’ key chord.
     Users exporting or running code blocks must load files only from
     trusted sources.  Be wary of customizing variables that remove or
     alter default security measures.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-babel-evaluate
          When ‘t’, Org prompts the user for confirmation before
          executing each code block.  When ‘nil’, Org executes code
          blocks without prompting the user for confirmation.  When this
          option is set to a custom function, Org invokes the function
          with these two arguments: the source code language and the
          body of the code block.  The custom function must return
          either a ‘t’ or ‘nil’, which determines if the user is
          prompted.  Each source code language can be handled separately
          through this function argument.

     For example, here is how to execute ditaa code blocks without
     prompting:

          (defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
            (not (string= lang "ditaa")))  ;don't ask for ditaa
          (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)

_Following ‘shell’ and ‘elisp’ links_
     Org has two link types that can directly evaluate code (see *note
     External Links::).  Because such code is not visible, these links
     have a potential risk.  Org therefore prompts the user when it
     encounters such links.  The customization variables are:

      -- User Option: org-confirm-shell-link-function
          Function that prompts the user before executing a shell link.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-elisp-link-function
          Function that prompts the user before executing an Emacs Lisp
          link.

_Formulas in tables_
     Formulas in tables (see *note The Spreadsheet::) are code that is
     evaluated either by the Calc interpreter, or by the Emacs Lisp
     interpreter.


File: org,  Node: Customization,  Next: In-buffer Settings,  Prev: Code Evaluation Security,  Up: Miscellaneous

15.6 Customization
==================

Org has more than 500 variables for customization.  They can be accessed
through the usual ‘M-x org-customize’ command.  Or through the Org menu:
Org → Customization → Browse Org Group.

   Org also has per-file settings for some variables (see *note
In-buffer Settings::).


File: org,  Node: In-buffer Settings,  Next: The Very Busy C-c C-c Key,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Miscellaneous

15.7 Summary of In-Buffer Settings
==================================

In-buffer settings start with ‘#+’, followed by a keyword, a colon, and
then a word for each setting.  Org accepts multiple settings on the same
line.  Org also accepts multiple lines for a keyword.  This manual
describes these settings throughout.  A summary follows here.

   ‘C-c C-c’ activates any changes to the in-buffer settings.  Closing
and reopening the Org file in Emacs also activates the changes.

‘#+ARCHIVE: %s_done’
     Sets the archive location of the agenda file.  The corresponding
     variable is ‘org-archive-location’.

‘#+CATEGORY’
     Sets the category of the agenda file, which applies to the entire
     document.

‘#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM ...’
     Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
     columns view is invoked in locations where no ‘COLUMNS’ property
     applies.

‘#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...’
     Set file-local values for constants that table formulas can use.
     This line sets the local variable
     ‘org-table-formula-constants-local’.  The global version of this
     variable is ‘org-table-formula-constants’.

‘#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:’
     Set tags that all entries in the file inherit from, including the
     top-level entries.

‘#+LINK: linkword replace’
     Each line specifies one abbreviation for one link.  Use multiple
     ‘LINK’ keywords for more, see *note Link Abbreviations::.  The
     corresponding variable is ‘org-link-abbrev-alist’.

‘#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default’
     This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
     three must be either letters A–Z or numbers 0–9.  The highest
     priority must have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.

‘#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value’
     This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the
     current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a
     property.

‘#+SETUPFILE: file’
     The setup file or a URL pointing to such file is for additional
     in-buffer settings.  Org loads this file and parses it for any
     settings in it only when Org opens the main file.  If URL is
     specified, the contents are downloaded and stored in a temporary
     file cache.  ‘C-c C-c’ on the settings line parses and loads the
     file, and also resets the temporary file cache.  Org also parses
     and loads the document during normal exporting process.  Org parses
     the contents of this document as if it was included in the buffer.
     It can be another Org file.  To visit the file—not a URL—use ‘C-c
     '’ while point is on the line with the file name.

‘#+STARTUP:’
     Startup options Org uses when first visiting a file.

     The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the
     outline tree.  The corresponding variable for global default
     settings is ‘org-startup-folded’ with a default value of ‘t’, which
     is the same as ‘overview’.

     ‘overview’
          Top-level headlines only.

     ‘content’
          All headlines.

     ‘showall’
          No folding on any entry.

     ‘showeverything’
          Show even drawer contents.

     Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable
     ‘org-startup-indented’(1).

     ‘indent’
          Start with ‘org-indent-mode’ turned on.

     ‘noindent’
          Start with ‘org-indent-mode’ turned off.

     Aligns tables consistently upon visiting a file.  The corresponding
     variable is ‘org-startup-align-all-tables’ with ‘nil’ as default
     value.

     ‘align’
          Align all tables.

     ‘noalign’
          Do not align tables on startup.

     Shrink table columns with a width cookie.  The corresponding
     variable is ‘org-startup-shrink-all-tables’ with ‘nil’ as default
     value.

     When visiting a file, inline images can be automatically displayed.
     The corresponding variable is ‘org-startup-with-inline-images’,
     with a default value ‘nil’ to avoid delays when visiting a file.

     ‘inlineimages’
          Show inline images.

     ‘noinlineimages’
          Do not show inline images on startup.

     Logging the closing and reopening of TODO items and clock intervals
     can be configured using these options (see variables
     ‘org-log-done’, ‘org-log-note-clock-out’, and ‘org-log-repeat’).

     ‘logdone’
          Record a timestamp when an item is marked DONE.

     ‘lognotedone’
          Record timestamp and a note when DONE.

     ‘nologdone’
          Do not record when items are marked DONE.

     ‘logrepeat’
          Record a time when reinstating a repeating item.

     ‘lognoterepeat’
          Record a note when reinstating a repeating item.

     ‘nologrepeat’
          Do not record when reinstating repeating item.

     ‘lognoteclock-out’
          Record a note when clocking out.

     ‘nolognoteclock-out’
          Do not record a note when clocking out.

     ‘logreschedule’
          Record a timestamp when scheduling time changes.

     ‘lognotereschedule’
          Record a note when scheduling time changes.

     ‘nologreschedule’
          Do not record when a scheduling date changes.

     ‘logredeadline’
          Record a timestamp when deadline changes.

     ‘lognoteredeadline’
          Record a note when deadline changes.

     ‘nologredeadline’
          Do not record when a deadline date changes.

     ‘logrefile’
          Record a timestamp when refiling.

     ‘lognoterefile’
          Record a note when refiling.

     ‘nologrefile’
          Do not record when refiling.

     Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings,
     and for indenting outlines.  The corresponding variables are
     ‘org-hide-leading-stars’ and ‘org-odd-levels-only’, both with a
     default setting ‘nil’ (meaning ‘showstars’ and ‘oddeven’).

     ‘hidestars’
          Make all but one of the stars starting a headline invisible.

     ‘showstars’
          Show all stars starting a headline.

     ‘indent’
          Virtual indentation according to outline level.

     ‘noindent’
          No virtual indentation according to outline level.

     ‘odd’
          Allow only odd outline levels (1, 3, ...).

     ‘oddeven’
          Allow all outline levels.

     To turn on custom format overlays over timestamps (variables
     ‘org-put-time-stamp-overlays’ and
     ‘org-time-stamp-overlay-formats’), use:

     ‘customtime’
          Overlay custom time format.

     The following options influence the table spreadsheet (variable
     ‘constants-unit-system’).

     ‘constcgs’
          ‘constants.el’ should use the c-g-s unit system.

     ‘constSI’
          ‘constants.el’ should use the SI unit system.

     To influence footnote settings, use the following keywords.  The
     corresponding variables are ‘org-footnote-define-inline’,
     ‘org-footnote-auto-label’, and ‘org-footnote-auto-adjust’.

     ‘fninline’
          Define footnotes inline.

     ‘fnnoinline’
          Define footnotes in separate section.

     ‘fnlocal’
          Define footnotes near first reference, but not inline.

     ‘fnprompt’
          Prompt for footnote labels.

     ‘fnauto’
          Create ‘[fn:1]’-like labels automatically (default).

     ‘fnconfirm’
          Offer automatic label for editing or confirmation.

     ‘fnadjust’
          Automatically renumber and sort footnotes.

     ‘nofnadjust’
          Do not renumber and sort automatically.

     To hide blocks on startup, use these keywords.  The corresponding
     variable is ‘org-hide-block-startup’.

     ‘hideblocks’
          Hide all begin/end blocks on startup.

     ‘nohideblocks’
          Do not hide blocks on startup.

     The display of entities as UTF-8 characters is governed by the
     variable ‘org-pretty-entities’ and the keywords

     ‘entitiespretty’
          Show entities as UTF-8 characters where possible.

     ‘entitiesplain’
          Leave entities plain.

‘#+TAGS: TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)’
     These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the valid tags
     in this file, and (potentially) the corresponding _fast tag
     selection_ keys.  The corresponding variable is ‘org-tag-alist’.

‘#+TODO:’
‘#+SEQ_TODO:’
‘#+TYP_TODO:’
     These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the
     current file.  The corresponding variable is ‘org-todo-keywords’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that ‘org-indent-mode’ also sets the ‘wrap-prefix’ property,
such that ‘visual-line-mode’ (or purely setting ‘word-wrap’) wraps long
lines (including headlines) correctly indented.

15.8 The Very Busy ‘C-c C-c’ Key
================================

The ‘C-c C-c’ key in Org serves many purposes depending on the context.
It is probably the most over-worked, multi-purpose key combination in
Org.  Its uses are well documented throughout this manual, but here is a
consolidated list for easy reference.

   • If any highlights shown in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
     tree, or from clock display, remove such highlights.

   • If point is in one of the special ‘KEYWORD’ lines, scan the buffer
     for these lines and update the information.  Also reset the Org
     file cache used to temporary store the contents of URLs used as
     values for keywords like ‘SETUPFILE’.

   • If point is inside a table, realign the table.  The table realigns
     even if automatic table editor is turned off.

   • If point is on a ‘TBLFM’ keyword, re-apply the formulas to the
     entire table.

   • If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close the note and file
     it.  With a prefix argument, also jump to the target location after
     saving the note.

   • If point is on a ‘<<<target>>>’, update radio targets and
     corresponding links in this buffer.

   • If point is on a property line or at the start or end of a property
     drawer, offer property commands.

   • If point is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
     definition, and _vice versa_.

   • If point is on a statistics cookie, update it.

   • If point is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the status
     of the checkbox.

   • If point is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
     ordered list.

   • If point is on the ‘#+BEGIN’ line of a dynamic block, the block is
     updated.

   • If point is at a timestamp, fix the day name in the timestamp.

15.9 A Cleaner Outline View
===========================

Org’s default outline with stars and no indents can become too cluttered
for short documents.  For _book-like_ long documents, the effect is not
as noticeable.  Org provides an alternate stars and indentation scheme,
as shown on the right in the following table.  It uses only one star and
indents text to line with the heading:

     * Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
     ** Second level                  |      * Second level
     *** Third level                  |        * Third level
         some text                    |          some text
     *** Third level                  |        * Third level
         more text                    |          more text
     * Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline

   To turn this mode on, use the minor mode, ‘org-indent-mode’.  Text
lines that are not headlines are prefixed with spaces to vertically
align with the headline text(1).

   To make more horizontal space, the headlines are shifted by two
stars.  This can be configured by the ‘org-indent-indentation-per-level’
variable.  Only one star on each headline is visible, the rest are
masked with the same font color as the background.

   Note that turning on ‘org-indent-mode’ sets ‘org-hide-leading-stars’
to ‘t’ and ‘org-adapt-indentation’ to ‘nil’.

   To globally turn on ‘org-indent-mode’ for all files, customize the
variable ‘org-startup-indented’.

   To turn on indenting for individual files, use ‘STARTUP’ keyword as
follows:

     #+STARTUP: indent

   Indent on startup makes Org use hard spaces to align text with
headings as shown in examples below.

_Indentation of text below headlines_
     Indent text to align with the headline.

          *** Third level
              more text, now indented

     Org supports this with paragraph filling, line wrapping, and
     structure editing, preserving or adapting the indentation as
     appropriate(2).

_Hiding leading stars_
     Org can make leading stars invisible.  For global preference,
     configure the variable ‘org-hide-leading-stars’.  For per-file
     preference, use these file ‘STARTUP’ options:

          #+STARTUP: hidestars
          #+STARTUP: showstars

     With stars hidden, the tree is shown as:

          * Top level headline
           * Second level
            * Third level
            ...

     Because Org makes the font color the same as the background color
     to hide to stars, sometimes ‘org-hide’ face may need tweaking to
     get the effect right.  For some black and white combinations,
     ‘grey90’ on a white background might mask the stars better.

_Odd levels_
     Using stars for only odd levels, 1, 3, 5, ..., can also clean up
     the clutter.  This removes two stars from each level(3).  For Org
     to properly handle this cleaner structure during edits and exports,
     configure the variable ‘org-odd-levels-only’.  To set this
     per-file, use either one of the following lines:

          #+STARTUP: odd
          #+STARTUP: oddeven

     To switch between single and double stars layouts, use ‘M-x
     org-convert-to-odd-levels’ and ‘M-x org-convert-to-oddeven-levels’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The ‘org-indent-mode’ also sets the ‘wrap-prefix’ correctly for
indenting and wrapping long lines of headlines or text.  This minor mode
handles ‘visual-line-mode’ and directly applied settings through
‘word-wrap’.

   (2) Also see the variable ‘org-adapt-indentation’.

   (3) Because ‘LEVEL=2’ has 3 stars, ‘LEVEL=3’ has 4 stars, and so on.


File: org,  Node: TTY Keys,  Next: Documentation Access,  Prev: Clean View,  Up: Miscellaneous

15.10 Using Org on a TTY
========================

Org provides alternative key bindings for TTY and modern mobile devices
that cannot perform movement commands on point and key bindings with
modifier keys.  Some of these workarounds may be more cumbersome than
necessary.  Users should look into customizing these further based on
their usage needs.  For example, the normal ‘S-<cursor>’ for editing
timestamp might be better with ‘C-c .’ chord.

Default        Alternative 1        Speed key   Alternative 2

15.11 Context Dependent Documentation
=====================================

‘C-c C-x C-i’ in an Org file tries to open a suitable section of the Org
info documentation depending on the Org element at point.  For example
on a headline the info documentation about the Org document structure
appears.

   ‘q’ closes the info window.

File: org,  Node: Cooperation,  Next: Conflicts,  Up: Interaction

15.12.1 Packages that Org cooperates with
-----------------------------------------

‘calc.el’ by Dave Gillespie

     Org uses the Calc package for implementing spreadsheet
     functionality in its tables (see *note The Spreadsheet::).  Org
     also uses Calc for embedded calculations.  See *note GNU Emacs Calc
     Manual: (calc)Embedded Mode.

‘constants.el’ by Carsten Dominik

     Org can use names for constants in formulas in tables.  Org can
     also use calculation suffixes for units, such as ‘M’ for ‘Mega’.
     For a standard collection of such constants, install the
     ‘constants’ package.  Install version 2.0 of this package,
     available at <http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools>.  Org checks
     if the function ‘constants-get’ has been autoloaded.  Installation
     instructions are in the file ‘constants.el’.

‘cdlatex.el’ by Carsten Dominik

     Org mode can make use of the CDLaTeX package to efficiently enter
     LaTeX fragments into Org files.  See *note CDLaTeX mode::.

‘imenu.el’ by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg

     Imenu creates dynamic menus based on an index of items in a file.
     Org mode supports Imenu menus.  Enable it with a mode hook as
     follows:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu")))

     By default the index is two levels deep—you can modify the depth
     using the option ‘org-imenu-depth’.

‘speedbar.el’ by Eric M. Ludlam

     Speedbar package creates a special Emacs frame for displaying files
     and index items in files.  Org mode supports Speedbar; users can
     drill into Org files directly from the Speedbar.  The ‘<’ in the
     Speedbar frame tweaks the agenda commands to that file or to a
     subtree.

‘table.el’ by Takaaki Ota

     Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and
     row-spanning, and alignment can be created using the Emacs table
     package by Takaaki Ota.  Org mode recognizes such tables and
     exports them properly.  ‘C-c '’ to edit these tables in a special
     buffer, much like Org’s code blocks.  Because of interference with
     other Org mode functionality, Takaaki Ota tables cannot be edited
     directly in the Org buffer.

     ‘C-c '’ (‘org-edit-special’)
          Edit a ‘table.el’ table.  Works when point is in a ‘table.el’
          table.

     ‘C-c ~​’ (‘org-table-create-with-table.el’)
          Insert a ‘table.el’ table.  If there is already a table at
          point, this command converts it between the ‘table.el’ format
          and the Org mode format.  See the documentation string of the
          command ‘org-convert-table’ for the restrictions under which
          this is possible.

15.12.2 Packages that conflict with Org mode
--------------------------------------------

In Emacs, ‘shift-selection-mode’ combines motions of point with shift
key to enlarge regions.  Emacs sets this mode by default.  This
conflicts with Org’s use of ‘S-<cursor>’ commands to change timestamps,
TODO keywords, priorities, and item bullet types, etc.  Since
‘S-<cursor>’ commands outside of specific contexts do not do anything,
Org offers the variable ‘org-support-shift-select’ for customization.
Org mode accommodates shift selection by (i) making it available outside
of the special contexts where special commands apply, and (ii) extending
an existing active region even if point moves across a special context.

‘cua.el’ by Kim F. Storm
     Org key bindings conflict with ‘S-<cursor>’ keys used by CUA mode.
     For Org to relinquish these bindings to CUA mode, configure the
     variable ‘org-replace-disputed-keys’.  When set, Org moves the
     following key bindings in Org files, and in the agenda buffer—but
     not during date selection.

     ‘S-<UP>’ ⇒ ‘M-p’              ‘S-<DOWN>’ ⇒ ‘M-n’
     ‘S-<LEFT>’ ⇒ ‘M--’            ‘S-<RIGHT>’ ⇒ ‘M-+’
     ‘C-S-<LEFT>’ ⇒ ‘M-S--’        ‘C-S-<RIGHT>’ ⇒ ‘M-S-+’

     Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you
     want to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
     ‘org-disputed-keys’.

‘ecomplete.el’ by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
     Ecomplete provides “electric” address completion in address header
     lines in message buffers.  Sadly Orgtbl mode cuts Ecomplete’s power
     supply: no completion happens when Orgtbl mode is enabled in
     message buffers while entering text in address header lines.  If
     one wants to use ecomplete one should _not_ follow the advice to
     automagically turn on Orgtbl mode in message buffers (see *note
     Orgtbl Mode::), but instead—after filling in the message
     headers—turn on Orgtbl mode manually when needed in the messages
     body.

‘filladapt.el’ by Kyle Jones
     Org mode tries to do the right thing when filling paragraphs, list
     items and other elements.  Many users reported problems using both
     ‘filladapt.el’ and Org mode, so a safe thing to do is to disable
     filladapt like this:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)

‘viper.el’ by Michael Kifer

     Viper uses ‘C-c /’ and therefore makes this key not access the
     corresponding Org mode command ‘org-sparse-tree’.  You need to find
     another key for this command, or override the key in
     ‘viper-vi-global-user-map’ with

          (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "C-c /" 'org-sparse-tree)

‘windmove.el’ by Hovav Shacham

     This package also uses the ‘S-<cursor>’ keys, so everything written
     in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.  If you
     want to make the windmove function active in locations where Org
     mode does not have special functionality on ‘S-<cursor>’, add this
     to your configuration:

          ;; Make windmove work in Org mode:
          (add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)
          (add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)

‘yasnippet.el’
     The way Org mode binds the ‘<TAB>’ key (binding to ‘[tab]’ instead
     of ‘"\t"’) overrules YASnippet’s access to this key.  The following
     code fixed this problem:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (setq-local yas/trigger-key [tab])
                      (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-or-maybe-expand)))

     The latest version of YASnippet does not play well with Org mode.
     If the above code does not fix the conflict, start by defining the
     following function:

          (defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
            (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))

     Then, tell Org mode to use that function:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (make-variable-buffer-local 'yas/trigger-key)
                      (setq yas/trigger-key [tab])
                      (add-to-list 'org-tab-first-hook 'yas/org-very-safe-expand)
                      (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field)))

15.13 Org Crypt
===============

Org Crypt encrypts the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties.  Behind the scene, it uses the Emacs EasyPG library to
encrypt and decrypt files.

   Any text below a headline that has a ‘crypt’ tag is automatically
encrypted when the file is saved.  To use a different tag, customize the
‘org-crypt-tag-matcher’ setting.

   Here is a suggestion for Org Crypt settings in Emacs init file:

     (require 'org-crypt)
     (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
     (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("crypt"))

     (setq org-crypt-key nil)
     ;; GPG key to use for encryption
     ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.

     (setq auto-save-default nil)
     ;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need to
     ;; turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.  Otherwise,
     ;; you'll get an (annoying) message each time you start Org.

     ;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
     ;;
     ;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-

   It’s possible to use different keys for different headings by
specifying the respective key as property ‘CRYPTKEY’, e.g.:

     * Totally secret :crypt:
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CRYPTKEY: 0x0123456789012345678901234567890123456789
       :END:

   Excluding the ‘crypt’ tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted
text from being encrypted again.


File: org,  Node: Org Mobile,  Next: Org Syntax,  Prev: Org Crypt,  Up: Miscellaneous

15.14 Org Mobile
================

Org Mobile is a protocol for synchronizing Org files between Emacs and
other applications, e.g., on mobile devices.  It enables offline-views
and capture support for an Org mode system that is rooted on a “real”
computer.  The external application can also record changes to existing
entries.

   This appendix describes Org’s support for agenda view formats
compatible with Org Mobile.  It also describes synchronizing changes,
such as to notes, between the mobile application and the computer.

   To change tags and TODO states in the mobile application, first
customize the variables ‘org-todo-keywords’ and ‘org-tag-alist’.  These
should cover all the important tags and TODO keywords, even if Org files
use only some of them.  Though the mobile application is expected to
support in-buffer settings, it is required to understand TODO states
_sets_ (see *note Per-file keywords::) and _mutually exclusive_ tags
(see *note Setting Tags::) only for those set in these variables.

* Menu:

* Setting up the staging area::  For the mobile device.
* Pushing to the mobile application:: Uploading Org files and agendas.
* Pulling from the mobile application:: Integrating captured and flagged items.


File: org,  Node: Setting up the staging area,  Next: Pushing to the mobile application,  Up: Org Mobile

15.14.1 Setting up the staging area
-----------------------------------

The mobile application needs access to a file directory on a server(1)
to interact with Emacs.  Pass its location through the
‘org-mobile-directory’ variable.  If you can mount that directory
locally just set the variable to point to that directory:

     (setq org-mobile-directory "~/orgmobile/")

   Alternatively, by using TRAMP (see *note TRAMP User Manual:
(tramp)Top.), ‘org-mobile-directory’ may point to a remote directory
accessible through, for example, SSH, SCP, or DAVS:

     (setq org-mobile-directory "/davs:user@remote.host:/org/webdav/")

   With a public server, consider encrypting the files.  Org also
requires OpenSSL installed on the local computer.  To turn on
encryption, set the same password in the mobile application and in
Emacs.  Set the password in the variable ‘org-mobile-use-encryption’(2).
Note that even after the mobile application encrypts the file contents,
the file name remains visible on the file systems of the local computer,
the server, and the mobile device.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For a server to host files, consider using a WebDAV server, such
as Nextcloud (https://nextcloud.com).  Additional help is at this FAQ
entry (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#mobileorg_webdav).

   (2) If Emacs is configured for safe storing of passwords, then
configure the variable ‘org-mobile-encryption-password’; please read the
docstring of that variable.


File: org,  Node: Pushing to the mobile application,  Next: Pulling from the mobile application,  Prev: Setting up the staging area,  Up: Org Mobile

15.14.2 Pushing to the mobile application
-----------------------------------------

The command ‘org-mobile-push’ copies files listed in ‘org-mobile-files’
into the staging area.  Files include agenda files (as listed in
‘org-agenda-files’).  Customize ‘org-mobile-files’ to add other files.
File names are staged with paths relative to ‘org-directory’, so all
files should be inside this directory(1).

   Push creates a special Org file ‘agendas.org’ with custom agenda
views defined by the user(2).

   Finally, Org writes the file ‘index.org’, containing links to other
files.  The mobile application reads this file first from the server to
determine what other files to download for agendas.  For faster
downloads, it is expected to only read files whose checksums(3) have
changed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Symbolic links in ‘org-directory’ need to have the same name as
their targets.

   (2) While creating the agendas, Org mode forces ‘ID’ properties on
all referenced entries, so that these entries can be uniquely identified
if Org Mobile flags them for further action.  To avoid setting
properties configure the variable ‘org-mobile-force-id-on-agenda-items’
to ‘nil’.  Org mode then relies on outline paths, assuming they are
unique.

   (3) Checksums are stored automatically in the file ‘checksums.dat’.


File: org,  Node: Pulling from the mobile application,  Prev: Pushing to the mobile application,  Up: Org Mobile

15.14.3 Pulling from the mobile application
-------------------------------------------

The command ‘org-mobile-pull’ synchronizes changes with the server.
More specifically, it first pulls the Org files for viewing.  It then
appends captured entries and pointers to flagged or changed entries to
the file ‘mobileorg.org’ on the server.  Org ultimately integrates its
data in an inbox file format, through the following steps:

  1. Org moves all entries found in ‘mobileorg.org’(1) and appends them
     to the file pointed to by the variable ‘org-mobile-inbox-for-pull’.
     It should reside neither in the staging area nor on the server.
     Each captured entry and each editing event is a top-level entry in
     the inbox file.

  2. After moving the entries, Org processes changes to the shared
     files.  Some of them are applied directly and without user
     interaction.  Examples include changes to tags, TODO state,
     headline and body text.  Entries requiring further action are
     tagged as ‘FLAGGED’.  Org marks entries with problems with an error
     message in the inbox.  They have to be resolved manually.

  3. Org generates an agenda view for flagged entries for user
     intervention to clean up.  For notes stored in flagged entries, Org
     displays them in the echo area when point is on the corresponding
     agenda item.

     ‘?’
          Pressing ‘?’ displays the entire flagged note in another
          window.  Org also pushes it to the kill ring.  To store
          flagged note as a normal note, use ‘? z C-y C-c C-c’.
          Pressing ‘?’ twice does these things: first it removes the
          ‘FLAGGED’ tag; second, it removes the flagged note from the
          property drawer; third, it signals that manual editing of the
          flagged entry is now finished.

   From the agenda dispatcher, ‘?’ returns to the view to finish
processing flagged entries.  Note that these entries may not be the most
recent since the mobile application searches files that were last
pulled.  To get an updated agenda view with changes since the last pull,
pull again.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The file will be empty after this operation.

15.15 Org Syntax
================

A reference document providing a formal description of Org’s syntax is
available as a draft on Worg
(https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html), written and maintained
by Nicolas Goaziou.  It defines Org’s core internal concepts such as
“headlines”, “sections”, “affiliated keywords”, “(greater) elements” and
“objects”.  Each part of an Org document belongs to one of the previous
categories.

   To explore the abstract structure of an Org buffer, run this in a
buffer:

     M-: (org-element-parse-buffer) <RET>

It outputs a list containing the buffer’s content represented as an
abstract structure.  The export engine relies on the information stored
in this list.  Most interactive commands—e.g., for structure
editing—also rely on the syntactic meaning of the surrounding context.

   You can probe the syntax of your documents with the command

     M-x org-lint <RET>

It runs a number of checks to find common mistakes.  It then displays
their location in a dedicated buffer, along with a description and a
“trust level”, since false-positive are possible.  From there, you can
operate on the reports with the following keys:

‘C-j’, ‘<TAB>’   Display the offending line
‘<RET>’          Move point to the offending line
‘g’              Check the document again
‘h’              Hide all reports from the same checker
‘i’              Also remove them from all subsequent checks
‘S’              Sort reports by the column at point

A.3 Adding Hyperlink Types
==========================

Org has many built-in hyperlink types (see *note Hyperlinks::), and an
interface for adding new link types.  The following example shows the
process of adding Org links to Unix man pages, which look like this

     [[man:printf][The printf manual]]

The following ‘org-man.el’ file implements it

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to man pages in Org mode
     (require 'org)

     (org-link-set-parameters "man"
                              :follow org-man-command
                              :export #'org-man-export
                              :store #'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a man page."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link.
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Man page for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (defun org-man-export (link description format)
       "Export a man page link from Org files."
       (let ((path (format "http://man.he.net/?topic=%s&section=all" link))
             (desc (or description link)))
         (pcase format
           (`html (format "<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%s\">%s</a>" path desc))
           (`latex (format "\\href{%s}{%s}" path desc))
           (`texinfo (format "@uref{%s,%s}" path desc))
           (`ascii (format "%s (%s)" desc path))
           (t path))))

     (provide 'org-man)
     ;;; org-man.el ends here

To activate links to man pages in Org, enter this in the Emacs init
file:

     (require 'org-man)

A review of ‘org-man.el’:

  1. First, ‘(require 'org)’ ensures ‘org.el’ is loaded.

  2. Then ‘org-link-set-parameters’ defines a new link type with ‘man’
     prefix and associates functions for following, exporting and
     storing such links.  See the variable ‘org-link-parameters’ for a
     complete list of possible associations.

  3. The rest of the file implements necessary variables and functions.

     For example, ‘org-man-store-link’ is responsible for storing a link
     when ‘org-store-link’ (see *note Handling Links::) is called from a
     buffer displaying a man page.  It first checks if the ‘major-mode’
     is appropriate.  If check fails, the function returns ‘nil’, which
     means it isn’t responsible for creating a link to the current
     buffer.  Otherwise the function makes a link string by combining
     the ‘man:’ prefix with the man topic.  It also provides a default
     description.  The function ‘org-insert-link’ can insert it back
     into an Org buffer later on.

A.4 Adding Export Back-ends
===========================

Org’s export engine makes it easy for writing new back-ends.  The
framework on which the engine was built makes it easy to derive new
back-ends from existing ones.

   The two main entry points to the export engine are:
‘org-export-define-backend’ and ‘org-export-define-derived-backend’.  To
grok these functions, see ‘ox-latex.el’ for an example of defining a new
back-end from scratch, and ‘ox-beamer.el’ for an example of deriving
from an existing engine.

   For creating a new back-end from scratch, first set its name as a
symbol in an alist consisting of elements and export functions.  To make
the back-end visible to the export dispatcher, set ‘:menu-entry’
keyword.  For export options specific to this back-end, set the
‘:options-alist’.

   For creating a new back-end from an existing one, set
‘:translate-alist’ to an alist of export functions.  This alist replaces
the parent back-end functions.

   For complete documentation, see the Org Export Reference on Worg
(https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html).

A.5 Tables in Arbitrary Syntax
==============================

Due to Org’s success in handling tables with Orgtbl, a frequently
requested feature is the use of Org’s table functions in other modes,
e.g., LaTeX.  This would be hard to do in a general way without
complicated customization nightmares.  Moreover, that would take Org
away from its simplicity roots that Orgtbl has proven.  There is,
however, an alternate approach to accomplishing the same.

   This approach involves implementing a custom _translate_ function
that operates on a native Org _source table_ to produce a table in
another format.  This strategy would keep the excellently working Orgtbl
simple and isolate complications, if any, confined to the translate
function.  To add more alien table formats, we just add more translate
functions.  Also the burden of developing custom translate functions for
new table formats is in the hands of those who know those formats best.

File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Up: Tables in Arbitrary Syntax

A.5.1 Radio tables
------------------

Radio tables are target locations for translated tables that are not
near their source.  Org finds the target location and inserts the
translated table.

   The key to finding the target location is the magic words ‘BEGIN/END
RECEIVE ORGTBL’.  They have to appear as comments in the current mode.
If the mode is C, then:

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

   At the location of source, Org needs a special line to direct Orgtbl
to translate and to find the target for inserting the translated table.
For example:

     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments ...

‘table_name’ is the table’s reference name, which is also used in the
receiver lines, and the ‘translation_function’ is the Lisp function that
translates.  This line, in addition, may also contain alternating key
and value arguments at the end.  The translation function gets these
values as a property list.  A few standard parameters are already
recognized and acted upon before the translation function is called:

‘:skip N’
     Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count; include them
     if they are to be skipped.

‘:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)’
     List of columns to be skipped.  First Org automatically discards
     columns with calculation marks and then sends the table to the
     translator function, which then skips columns as specified in
     ‘skipcols’.

   To keep the source table intact in the buffer without being disturbed
when the source file is compiled or otherwise being worked on, use one
of these strategies:

   • Place the table in a block comment.  For example, in C mode you
     could wrap the table between ‘/*’ and ‘*/’ lines.

   • Put the table after an “end” statement.  For example ‘\bye’ in TeX
     and ‘\end{document}’ in LaTeX.

   • Comment and un-comment each line of the table during edits.  The
     ‘M-x orgtbl-toggle-comment’ command makes toggling easy.


File: org,  Node: A LaTeX example,  Next: Translator functions,  Prev: Radio tables,  Up: Tables in Arbitrary Syntax

A.5.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

To wrap a source table in LaTeX, use the ‘comment’ environment provided
by ‘comment.sty’(1).  To activate it, put ‘\usepackage{comment}’ in the
document header.  Orgtbl mode inserts a radio table skeleton(2) with the
command ‘M-x orgtbl-insert-radio-table’, which prompts for a table name.
For example, if ‘salesfigures’ is the name, the template inserts:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The line ‘#+ORGTBL: SEND’ tells Orgtbl mode to use the function
‘orgtbl-to-latex’ to convert the table to LaTeX format, then insert the
table at the target (receive) location named ‘salesfigures’.  Now the
table is ready for data entry.  It can even use spreadsheet features(3):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep Font Lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

   After editing, ‘C-c C-c’ inserts the translated table at the target
location, between the two marker lines.

   For hand-made custom tables, note that the translator needs to skip
the first two lines of the source table.  Also the command has to
_splice_ out the target table without the header and footer.

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function ‘orgtbl-to-latex’ is already part of
Orgtbl mode and uses a ‘tabular’ environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with ‘\hline’.  For additional parameters to
control output, see *note Translator functions:::

‘:splice BOOLEAN’
     When {{{var(BOOLEAN}}} is non-‘nil’, return only table body lines;
     i.e., not wrapped in ‘tabular’ environment.  Default is ‘nil’.

‘:fmt FMT’
     Format string to warp each field.  It should contain ‘%s’ for the
     original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in
     dollar symbol, you could use ‘:fmt "$%s$"’.  Format can also wrap a
     property list with column numbers and formats, for example ‘:fmt (2
     "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")’.  In place of a string, a function of one
     argument can be used; the function must return a formatted string.

‘:efmt EFMT’
     Format numbers as exponentials.  The spec should have ‘%s’ twice
     for inserting mantissa and exponent, for example
     ‘"%s\\times10^{%s}"’.  This may also be a property list with column
     numbers and formats, for example ‘:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4
     "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")’.  After EFMT has been applied to a value,
     FMT—see above—is also applied.  Functions with two arguments can be
     supplied instead of strings.  By default, no special formatting is
     applied.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (2) Because ‘LEVEL=2’ has 3 stars, ‘LEVEL=3’ has 4 stars, and so on.

   (3) If the ‘TBLFM’ keyword contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with Font Lock in LaTeX mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
‘comment’ environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the ‘comment’ environment to the variable
‘LaTeX-verbatim-environments’.

A.5.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl mode has built-in translator functions: ‘orgtbl-to-csv’
(comma-separated values), ‘orgtbl-to-tsv’ (TAB-separated values),
‘orgtbl-to-latex’, ‘orgtbl-to-html’, ‘orgtbl-to-texinfo’,
‘orgtbl-to-unicode’ and ‘orgtbl-to-orgtbl’.  They use the generic
translator, ‘orgtbl-to-generic’, which delegates translations to various
export back-ends.

   Properties passed to the function through the ‘ORGTBL SEND’ line take
precedence over properties defined inside the function.  For example,
this overrides the default LaTeX line endings, ‘\\’, with ‘\\[2mm]’:

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language translator, define a converter function.  It can
be a generic function, such as shown in this example.  It marks a
beginning and ending of a table with ‘!BTBL!’ and ‘!ETBL!’; a beginning
and ending of lines with ‘!BL!’ and ‘!EL!’; and uses a TAB for a field
separator:

     (defun orgtbl-to-language (table params)
       "Convert the orgtbl-mode TABLE to language."
       (orgtbl-to-generic
        table
        (org-combine-plists
         '(:tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!" :lstart "!BL!" :lend "!EL!" :sep "\t")
         params)))

The documentation for the ‘orgtbl-to-generic’ function shows a complete
list of parameters, each of which can be passed through to
‘orgtbl-to-latex’, ‘orgtbl-to-texinfo’, and any other function using
that generic function.

   For complicated translations the generic translator function could be
replaced by a custom translator function.  Such a custom function must
take two arguments and return a single string containing the formatted
table.  The first argument is the table whose lines are a list of fields
or the symbol ‘hline’.  The second argument is the property list
consisting of parameters specified in the ‘#+ORGTBL: SEND’ line.  Please
share your translator functions by posting them to the Org users mailing
list, at <emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic Blocks,  Next: Special Agenda Views,  Prev: Tables in Arbitrary Syntax,  Up: Hacking

A.6 Dynamic Blocks
==================

Org supports _dynamic blocks_ in Org documents.  They are inserted with
begin and end markers like any other code block, but the contents are
updated automatically by a user function.  For example, ‘C-c C-x C-r’
inserts a dynamic table that updates the work time (see *note Clocking
Work Time::).

   Dynamic blocks can have names and function parameters.  The syntax is
similar to source code block specifications:

     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...
       ...
     #+END:

   These commands update dynamic blocks:

‘C-c C-x C-u’ (‘org-dblock-update’)
     Update dynamic block at point.

‘C-u C-c C-x C-u’
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Before updating a dynamic block, Org removes content between the
‘BEGIN’ and ‘END’ markers.  Org then reads the parameters on the ‘BEGIN’
line for passing to the writer function.  If the function expects to
access the removed content, then Org expects an extra parameter,
‘:content’, on the ‘BEGIN’ line.

   The syntax for naming a writer function with a dynamic block labelled
‘myblock’ is: ‘org-dblock-write:myblock’.  Parameters come from the
‘BEGIN’ line.

   The following is an example of a dynamic block and a block writer
function that updates the time when the function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"
       ...
     #+END:

The dynamic block’s writer function:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
       (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
         (insert "Last block update at: "
                 (format-time-string fmt))))

   To keep dynamic blocks up-to-date in an Org file, use the function,
‘org-update-all-dblocks’ in hook, such as ‘before-save-hook’.  The
‘org-update-all-dblocks’ function does not run if the file is not in Org
mode.

   Dynamic blocks, like any other block, can be narrowed with
‘org-narrow-to-block’.


File: org,  Node: Special Agenda Views,  Next: Speeding Up Your Agendas,  Prev: Dynamic Blocks,  Up: Hacking

A.7 Special Agenda Views
========================

Org provides a special hook to further limit items in agenda views:
‘agenda’, ‘agenda*’(1), ‘todo’, ‘alltodo’, ‘tags’, ‘tags-todo’,
‘tags-tree’.  Specify a custom function that tests inclusion of every
matched item in the view.  This function can also skip as much as is
needed.

   For a global condition applicable to agenda views, use the
‘org-agenda-skip-function-global’ variable.  Org uses a global condition
with ‘org-agenda-skip-function’ for custom searching.

   This example defines a function for a custom view showing TODO items
with ‘waiting’ status.  Manually this is a multi-step search process,
but with a custom view, this can be automated as follows:

   The custom function searches the subtree for the ‘waiting’ tag and
returns ‘nil’ on match.  Otherwise it gives the location from where the
search continues.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   To use this custom function in a custom agenda command:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds ‘org-agenda-overriding-header’ to a more
meaningful string suitable for the agenda view.

   Search for entries with a limit set on levels for the custom search.
This is a general approach to creating custom searches in Org.  To
include all levels, use ‘LEVEL>0’(2).  Then to selectively pick the
matched entries, use ‘org-agenda-skip-function’, which also accepts Lisp
forms, such as ‘org-agenda-skip-entry-if’ and
‘org-agenda-skip-subtree-if’.  For example:

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)’
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)’
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)’
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)’
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '("TODO" "WAITING"))’
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword is TODO or WAITING.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)’
     Skip current entry if the TODO keyword marks a DONE state.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp)’
     Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline or
     scheduled.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'regexp "regular expression")’
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

‘(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "regular expression")’
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

‘(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")’
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   The following is an example of a search for ‘waiting’ without the
special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":waiting:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The ‘agenda*’ view is the same as ‘agenda’ except that it only
considers _appointments_, i.e., scheduled and deadline items that have a
time specification ‘[h]h:mm’ in their time-stamps.

   (2) Note that, for ‘org-odd-levels-only’, a level number corresponds
to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of stars.


File: org,  Node: Speeding Up Your Agendas,  Next: Extracting Agenda Information,  Prev: Special Agenda Views,  Up: Hacking

A.8 Speeding Up Your Agendas
============================

Some agenda commands slow down when the Org files grow in size or
number.  Here are tips to speed up:

   • Reduce the number of Org agenda files to avoid slowdowns due to
     hard drive accesses.

   • Reduce the number of DONE and archived headlines so agenda
     operations that skip over these can finish faster.

   • Do not dim blocked tasks:

          (setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks nil)

   • Stop preparing agenda buffers on startup:

          (setq org-agenda-inhibit-startup t)

   • Disable tag inheritance for agendas:

          (setq org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance nil)

   These options can be applied to selected agenda views.  For more
details about generation of agenda views, see the docstrings for the
relevant variables, and this dedicated Worg page
(https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html) for agenda
optimization.

A.9 Extracting Agenda Information
=================================

Org provides commands to access agendas through Emacs batch mode.
Through this command-line interface, agendas are automated for further
processing or printing.

   ‘org-batch-agenda’ creates an agenda view in ASCII and outputs to
standard output.  This command takes one string parameter.  When string
consists of a single character, Org uses it as a key to
‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  These are the same ones available through
the agenda dispatcher (see *note Agenda Dispatcher::).

   This example command line directly prints the TODO list to the
printer:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr

   When the string parameter length is two or more characters, Org
matches it with tags/TODO strings.  For example, this example command
line prints items tagged with ‘shop’, but excludes items tagged with
‘NewYork’:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
           -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr

An example showing on-the-fly parameter modifications:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
        -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
                org-agenda-span (quote month)                      \
                org-agenda-include-diary nil                       \
                org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'   \
        | lpr

which produces an agenda for the next 30 days from just the
‘~/org/projects.org’ file.

   For structured processing of agenda output, use
‘org-batch-agenda-csv’ with the following fields:

category
     The category of the item
head
     The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY
type
     The type of the agenda entry, can be

     ‘todo’                selected in TODO match
     ‘tagsmatch’           selected in tags match
     ‘diary’               imported from diary
     ‘deadline’            a deadline
     ‘scheduled’           scheduled
     ‘timestamp’           appointment, selected by timestamp
     ‘closed’              entry was closed on date
     ‘upcoming-deadline’   warning about nearing deadline
     ‘past-scheduled’      forwarded scheduled item
     ‘block’               entry has date block including date

todo
     The TODO keyword, if any
tags
     All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
date
     The relevant date, like ‘2007-2-14’
time
     The time, like ‘15:00-16:50’
extra
     String with extra planning info
priority-l
     The priority letter if any was given
priority-n
     The computed numerical priority

   If the selection of the agenda item was based on a timestamp,
including those items with ‘DEADLINE’ and ‘SCHEDULED’ keywords, then Org
includes date and time in the output.

   If the selection of the agenda item was based on a timestamp (or
deadline/scheduled), then Org includes date and time in the output.

   Here is an example of a post-processing script in Perl.  It takes the
CSV output from Emacs and prints with a checkbox:

     #!/usr/bin/perl

     # define the Emacs command to run
     $cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

     # run it and capture the output
     $agenda = qx{$cmd 2>/dev/null};

     # loop over all lines
     foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) {
         # get the individual values
         ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
          $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
         # process and print
         print "[ ] $head\n";
     }

A.10 Using the Property API
===========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.  This
     includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,
     scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in
     the entry.  The return value is an alist.  Keys may occur multiple
     times if the property key was used several times.  POM may also be
     ‘nil’, in which case the current entry is used.  If WHICH is ‘nil’
     or ‘all’, get all properties.  If WHICH is ‘special’ or ‘standard’,
     only get that subclass.

 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  By
     default, this only looks at properties defined locally in the
     entry.  If INHERIT is non-‘nil’ and the entry does not have the
     property, then also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  If
     INHERIT is the symbol ‘selective’, use inheritance if and only if
     the setting of ‘org-use-property-inheritance’ selects PROPERTY for
     inheritance.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set PROPERTY to VALUES for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer for the current entry.  Also

 -- Function: org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest
          values
     Set PROPERTY at point-or-marker POM to VALUES.  VALUES should be a
     list of strings.  They are concatenated, with spaces as separators.

 -- Function: org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and return the values as a list of strings.

 -- Function: org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is _not_ in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-member-in-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and check if VALUE is in this list.

 -- User Option: org-property-allowed-value-functions
     Hook for functions supplying allowed values for a specific
     property.  The functions must take a single argument, the name of
     the property, and return a flat list of allowed values.  If ‘:ETC’
     is one of the values, use the values as completion help, but allow
     also other values to be entered.  The functions must return ‘nil’
     if they are not responsible for this property.

A.11 Using the Mapping API
==========================

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries
satisfying certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to
produce agenda views, but there is also an API that can be used to
execute arbitrary functions for each or selected entries.  The main
entry point for this API is:

 -- Function: org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
     Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

     FUNC is a function or a Lisp form.  With point positioned at the
     beginning of the headline, call the function without arguments.
     Org returns an alist of return values of calls to the function.

     To avoid preserving point, Org wraps the call to FUNC in
     ‘save-excursion’ form.  After evaluation, Org moves point to the
     end of the line that was just processed.  Search continues from
     that point forward.  This may not always work as expected under
     some conditions, such as if the current sub-tree was removed by a
     previous archiving operation.  In such rare circumstances, Org
     skips the next entry entirely when it should not.  To stop Org from
     such skips, make FUNC set the variable ‘org-map-continue-from’ to a
     specific buffer position.

     MATCH is a tags/property/TODO match.  Org iterates only matched
     headlines.  Org iterates over all headlines when MATCH is ‘nil’ or
     ‘t’.

     SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

     ‘nil’
          The current buffer, respecting the restriction, if any.

     ‘tree’
          The subtree started with the entry at point.

     ‘region’
          The entries within the active region, if any.

     ‘file’
          The current buffer, without restriction.

     ‘file-with-archives’
          The current buffer, and any archives associated with it.

     ‘agenda’
          All agenda files.

     ‘agenda-with-archives’
          All agenda files with any archive files associated with them.

     list of filenames
          If this is a list, all files in the list are scanned.

     The remaining arguments are treated as settings for the scanner’s
     skipping facilities.  Valid arguments are:

     ‘archive’
          Skip trees with the ‘ARCHIVE’ tag.

     ‘comment’
          Skip trees with the COMMENT keyword.

     function or Lisp form
          Used as value for ‘org-agenda-skip-function’, so whenever the
          function returns ‘t’, FUNC is called for that entry and search
          continues from the point where the function leaves it.

   The mapping routine can call any arbitrary function, even functions
that change meta data or query the property API (see *note Using the
Property API::).  Here are some handy functions:

 -- Function: org-todo &optional arg
     Change the TODO state of the entry.  See the docstring of the
     functions for the many possible values for the argument ARG.

 -- Function: org-priority &optional action
     Change the priority of the entry.  See the docstring of this
     function for the possible values for ACTION.

 -- Function: org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
     Toggle the tag TAG in the current entry.  Setting ONOFF to either
     ‘on’ or ‘off’ does not toggle tag, but ensure that it is either on
     or off.

 -- Function: org-promote
     Promote the current entry.

 -- Function: org-demote
     Demote the current entry.

   This example turns all entries tagged with ‘TOMORROW’ into TODO
entries with keyword ‘UPCOMING’.  Org ignores entries in comment trees
and archive trees.

     (org-map-entries '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
                      "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)

   The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
‘WAITING’, in all agenda files.

     (length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))

Appendix B History and Acknowledgments
**************************************

B.1 From Carsten
================

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of the
Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and projects, and
using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However, having to
remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per command,
only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely
unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package ‘outline-magic.el’, but quickly
moved to the more general ‘org.el’.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _timestamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlighted the two main goals that Org still has today: to be a new,
outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing
features, and to incorporate project planning functionality directly
into a notes file.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
the mailing list <emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> have provided a constant stream
of bug reports, feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on
code.  Many thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.
I am trying to keep here a list of the people who had significant
influence in shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be
complete, if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and
let me know.

   Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:

Bastien Guerry
     Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of
     them integrated into the core by now), including the LaTeX exporter
     and the plain list parser.  His support during the early days was
     central to the success of this project.  Bastien also invented
     Worg, helped establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsored
     hosting costs for the orgmode.org website.  Bastien stepped in as
     maintainer of Org between 2011 and 2013, at a time when I
     desperately needed a break.

Eric Schulte and Dan Davison
     Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org Babel system,
     which turns Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating
     code and doing literate programming and reproducible research.
     This has become one of Org’s killer features that define what Org
     is today.

John Wiegley
     John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly
     to Org, including the attachment system (‘org-attach.el’),
     integration with Apple Mail (‘org-mac-message.el’), hierarchical
     dependencies of TODO items, habit tracking (‘org-habits.el’), and
     encryption (‘org-crypt.el’).  Also, the capture system is really an
     extended copy of his great ‘remember.el’.

Sebastian Rose
     Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the
     pitiful work of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this
     part of Org onto a much higher level.  He also wrote ‘org-info.js’,
     a Java script for displaying webpages derived from Org using an
     Info-like or a folding interface with single-key navigation.

   See below for the full list of contributions!  Again, please let me
know what I am missing here!

B.2 From Bastien
================

I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org between 2011 and 2013.  This
appendix would not be complete without adding a few more acknowledgments
and thanks.

   I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me over
the maintainership of Org.  His unremitting support is what really
helped me getting more confident over time, with both the community and
the code.

   When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make Org more
collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on people that are more
knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the code.  Here is a list of
the persons I could rely on, they should really be considered
co-maintainers, either of the code or the community:

Eric Schulte
     Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org.  His reactivity here
     kept me away from worrying about possible bugs here and let me
     focus on other parts.

Nicolas Goaziou
     Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest parts of Org.
     His work on ‘org-element.el’ and ‘ox.el’ has been outstanding, and
     it opened the doors for many new ideas and features.  He rewrote
     many of the old exporters to use the new export engine, and helped
     with documenting this major change.  More importantly (if that’s
     possible), he has been more than reliable during all the work done
     for Org 8.0, and always very reactive on the mailing list.

Achim Gratz
     Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some _ad hoc_
     tools into a flexible and conceptually clean process.  He patiently
     coped with the many hiccups that such a change can create for
     users.

Nick Dokos
     The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place without
     Nick, who patiently helped users so many times.  It is impossible
     to overestimate such a great help, and the list would not be so
     active without him.

   I received support from so many users that it is clearly impossible
to be fair when shortlisting a few of them, but Org’s history would not
be complete if the ones above were not mentioned in this manual.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
