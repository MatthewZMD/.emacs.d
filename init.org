* About EMACS
  Emacs changes how you /think/ about programming.

  Emacs is *totally introspectable*. You can always find out 'what code runs when I press this button?'.

  Emacs is an *incremental programming environment*. There's no edit-compile-run cycle. There isn't even an edit-run cycle. You can execute snippets of code and gradually turn them into a finished project. There's no distinction between your editor and your interpreter.

  Emacs is a *mutable environment*. You can set variables, tweak functions with advice, or redefine entire functions. Nothing is off-limits.

  Emacs provides *functionality without applications*. Rather than separate applications, functionality is all integrated into your Emacs instance. Amazingly, this works. Ever wanted to use the same snippet tool for writing C++ classes as well as emails?

  Emacs is full of *incredible software concepts that haven't hit the mainstream yet*. For example:
  - Many platforms have a single item clipboard. Emacs has an *infinite clipboard*.
  - If you undo a change, and then continue editing, you can't redo the original change. Emacs allows *undoing to any historical state*, even allowing tree-based exploration of history.
  - Emacs supports a *reverse variable search*: you can find variables with a given value.
  - You can perform *structural editing* of code, allowing you to make changes without breaking syntax. This works for lisps (paredit) and non-lisps (smartparens).
  - Many applications use a modal GUI: for example, you can't do other edits during a find-and-replace operation. Emacs provides *recursive editing* that allow you to suspend what you're currently doing, perform other edits, then continue the original task.
  Emacs has a *documentation culture*. Emacs includes a usage manual, a lisp programming manual, pervasive docstrings and even an interactive tutorial.

  Emacs has a *broad ecosystem*. If you want to edit code in a niche language, there's probably an Emacs package for it.

  Emacs doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are other great tools out there. Nonetheless, we believe the [[https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cu9Z.jpg][Emacs learning curve]] pays off.

  /This beautifully written *About EMACS* section credits to [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs][Remacs]]./
* About M-EMACS
  M-EMACS is a custom GNU Emacs setup and configuration distribution that aims not only to enhance the default Emacs experience, and hopefully be a sample that everyone can easily navigate and reference through a highly detailed README that contains 99% of the *entire* configuration code.

  As a young EMACSer, I have experienced the struggle to find a detailed configuration that is loosely coupled and highly readable. This mostly due to the nature of source codes, sometimes comments are harder to notice or simply not enough. Therefore I decided to construct this README and present any human-readable explanation in a much more human-friendly way. Anyone, particularly Emacs beginners who have no idea where to start with their personal config, is more than welcome to read through this document and copy/paste any part to use it on their own.

  This distribution is designed and tested for *GNU Emacs 26.1 and above only*. However, it is always suggested to use *Emacs 27*, the latest stable version released, for its significant improvement in the core that's out of the scope of M-EMACS.

** Community Responses ❤️
   Some heartwarming responses from the Emacs community:
   - /"Actually I understated how much I liked reading through your config... What makes me excited about this config is the readability and possibility of extending in a similar way."/ -- from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eewwyh/officially_introducing_memacs/fc5x1lz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][u/Orgmonics]]
   - /"I have to say Matt's setup has the best clarity of all emacs setups I have ever tried. It's really a good template to develop your own emacs config. Thanks again..."/ -- from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eewwyh/officially_introducing_memacs/fbxk831?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][u/fqye]]
   - /"Thanks for the fantastic emacs setup, I love emacs, but trying to get lsp working right was killing me, yours worked out of the box and all I had to do was add some bindings, it's really a time saver"/ -- from [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d/issues/48#issuecomment-877827124][ahonnecke]]
   - /"Thank you for helping a guy out and for sharing this. I hope this evolves to be into something really big."/ -- from [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d/issues/38#issuecomment-706657288][d3v-S]]
   - and more... Love you guys! ❤️❤️
** About README
   This README is originated from =init.org= that is generated using =M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown=. Every block of code is generated through this function - it exports sections of code from the =elisp/= directory. You will not see their presence in =init.org=. This not only enables a cleaner organization but also significantly improves Emacs start-up time than the traditional /everything in an org file/ approach.
** Installation
   1. Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
      - (Optional) On Ubuntu, =emacs-snapshot= is a great way to get latest version of Emacs.
        #+BEGIN_SRC bash
          sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-elisp
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
        #+END_SRC
      - (Optional) Build latest Emacs from source.
        #+BEGIN_SRC bash
          # Install essential build tools
          sudo apt-get install build-essential texinfo libx11-dev libxpm-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libgtk2.0-dev libncurses-dev gnutls-dev libgtk-3-dev git autoconf
          # Clone source
          git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git
          # Go to source
          cd emacs/
          # Build Emacs
          ./autogen.sh
          ./configure --with-mailutils
          make
          # Install (optional)
          sudo make install
        #+END_SRC
   2. Clone this repo to =HOME= or =~/= path using [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] and update all the submodules.
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        cd ~
        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d.git
        cd .emacs.d
      #+END_SRC
   3. Ensure a stable connection to Melpa Packages, then open Emacs.
   4. Enter =y= when prompted with =Auto-update packages now?=, wait for all packages to install.
   5. In your favorite browser, =Ctrl-f Prerequisite= through this README and follow the *Prerequisite* instructions.
   6. Restart Emacs.
*** Further Updates
    I will be updating M-EMACS from time to time, it is best to =git pull= once a while to stay up to date.

    Please also execute =git submodule update --recursive --remote= to sync with all the submodules.
** Modification
   You have the permission to use, modify, distribute in any way you want.

   However, what is /free/ stays /free/. After all, this is [[file:LICENSE][GPL]].

   *Remember* you must manually sync this README with all the new changes you made by:
   1. Please do *NOT* edit this =README.md= file, edit =init.org= instead!
   2. If you add a new mode, create a new =<file-name>.el= file in =elisp/= directory.
   3. Put =(require '<file-name>)= in [[file:init.el][init.el]] accordingly.
   4. Add =#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/<place-holder>.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "<start-line-wrapper-exclusive>" :range-end "<end-line-wrapper-exclusive>"= in the appropriate section in =init.org=.
   5. Enter =C-x C-s= to save and update =:lines=. (if you don't see the updated effect, run =M-x save-and-update-includes= manually)
   6. Call =M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown= to update =README.md= automatically.

* Startup
** Lexical Binding
   Use lexical-binding. [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][Why?]]
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Until Emacs 24.1 (June 2012), Elisp only had dynamically scoped variables, a feature, mostly by accident, common to old lisp dialects. While dynamic scope has some selective uses, it’s widely regarded as a mistake for local variables, and virtually no other languages have adopted it.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :lines "1-2"
** Early Init
   Emacs27 introduces =early-init.el=, which is run before =init.el=, before package and UI initialization happens.
*** Compatibility With 26
    Ensure =emacs-version>=26=, manually require =early-init= configurations if =emacs-version<27=.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CheckVer" :range-end "-CheckVer" :lines "39-51"
*** Defer Garbage Collection
    Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process, according to [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly][hlissner]].
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The GC eats up quite a bit of time, easily doubling startup time. The trick is to turn up the memory threshold as early as possible.
    #+END_QUOTE
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DeferGC" :range-end "-DeferGC"  :lines "40-41"
*** Disable =package-enable-at-startup=
    Package initialize occurs automatically, before =user-init-file= is loaded, but after =early-init-file=.
    We handle package initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetPES" :range-end "-UnsetPES"  :lines "44-45"
*** Unset =file-name-handler-alist=
    Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it won’t need any of them.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetFNHA" :range-end "-UnsetFNHA" :lines "48-50"
*** Disable =site-run-file=
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetSRF" :range-end "-UnsetSRF" :lines "53-54"
*** Disable Unnecessary Interface
    It will be faster to disable them here before they've been initialized.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DisableUnnecessaryInterface" :range-end "-DisableUnnecessaryInterface" :lines "57-62"
** Garbage Collection
*** Set =gc-cons-threshold= Smaller for Interactive Use
    A large =gc-cons-threshold= may cause freezing and stuttering during long-term interactive use.

    If you experience freezing, decrease this amount, if you experience stuttering, increase this amount.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "BetterGC" :range-end "-BetterGC" :lines "54-64"
    Garbage Collect when Emacs is out of focus and avoid garbage collection when using minibuffer.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "AutoGC" :range-end "-AutoGC" :lines "67-84"
** Load Path
   Since all the configuration files are stored in =elisp/= folder, they need to be added to =load-path= now.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "LoadPath" :range-end "-LoadPath"  :lines "87-101"
** Define Constants
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-const.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "Consts" :range-end "-Consts"  :lines "44-76"
** Load Private File
   An =init-private.el= file has been designated at =user-emacs-directory= for you to store personal configurations that you don't want to source-control.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "InitPrivate" :range-end "-InitPrivate"  :lines "229-232"
* Package Management
  Some packages are disabled with the =:disabled= tag, because I don't use them very often. You can disable packages similarly yourself too:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package foo
      :disabled)
  #+end_src
** Melpa Packages
   Configure package archives, where to install online packages and add them to =load-path=.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "MelpaPackages" :range-end "-MelpaPackages" :lines "40-50"
** Non-Melpa Packages
   Add packages contained in =site-elisp/= to =load-path= too.
*** Add Packages Manually from Git
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      cd site-elisp/
      git submodule add https://github.com/foo/bar.git
    #+END_SRC
    Verify =.gitmodules= file that the newly added package exist.
*** Update Manually Added Packages
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git submodule init
      git submodule update
    #+END_SRC
** Configure Package Manager
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "ConfigurePackageManager" :range-end "-ConfigurePackageManager" :lines "53-61"
** Use Package
   My Emacs configuration is almost entirely dependant on [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The =use-package= macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your .emacs file in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy. I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage. Yet with this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "ConfigureUsePackage" :range-end "-ConfigureUsePackage"  :lines "64-78"
** Auto Package Update
   [[https://github.com/rranelli/auto-package-update.el][Auto package update]] automatically updates installed packages if at least =auto-package-update-interval= days have passed since the last update.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "AutoPackageUpdate" :range-end "-AutoPackageUpdate" :lines "81-90"
** Diminish
   [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/diminish][Diminish]], a feature that removes certain minor modes from mode-line.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DimPac" :range-end "-DimPac" :lines "93-94"
* Global Functionalities
** User Information
   *Prerequisite*: Please update this file your personal info.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-const.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UserInfo" :range-end "-UserInfo"" :lines "39-41"
** Bindings
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-global-config.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DefBindings" :range-end "-DefBindings"" :lines "47-64"
