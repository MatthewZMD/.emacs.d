* M-EMACS
* About
  M-EMACS is a custom GNU Emacs setup and configurations that aims not only to enhance the default Emacs experience, and hopefully be a sample that everyone can easily navigate and reference through a highly detailed README that contains 99% of the *entire* configuration code.

  As a young EMACSer, I have experienced the struggle to find a detailed configuration that is loosely coupled and highly readable. This mostly due to the nature of source codes, sometimes comments are harder to notice or simply not enough. Therefore I decided to construct this README and present any human-readable explanation in a much more human-friendly way. Anyone, particularly Emacs beginners who have no idea where to start with their personal config, is more than welcome to read through this document and copy/paste any part to use it on their own.

  This configuration is designed and tested for *GNU Emacs 25.1 and above only*. However, it is suggested to use *emacs27*, the latest version currently available.
  #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CheckVer" :range-end "-CheckVer" :lines "40-42"
** About README
   This README is originated from init.org that is generated using =M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown=. Every block of code is generated through this function - it exports the section of code from the =elisp/= directory. You will not see their presence in init.org.
** Installation
   1. Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
   2. Clone this repo to =HOME= or =~/= path using [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] and update all the submodules.
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d.git
        cd .emacs.d
      #+END_SRC
   3. Ensure a stable connection to Melpa Packages, then open Emacs.
   4. Enter =y= when prompted with =Auto-update packages now?=, wait for all packages to install.
   5. In your favorite browser, =Ctrl-F Prerequisite= through this webpage and follow the *Prerequisite* instructions.
   6. Restart Emacs.
*** Further Updates
    I will be updating M-EMACS from time to time, it is best to =git pull= once a while to stay up to date.

    Please also execute =git submodule update --recursive --remote= to sync with all the submodules.
** Modification
   You have the permission to use, modify, distribute in any way you want. However, what is /free/ stays /free/. After all, this is [[file:LICENSE][GPL]].

   *Remember* you must manually sync this README with all the new changes you made by:
   1. Please do *NOT* edit README.md file, edit init.org instead!
   2. If you add a new mode, create a new =<file-name>.el= file in =elisp/= directory.
   3. Put =(require '<file-name>)= in [[file:init.el][init.el]] accordingly.
   4. Add =#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/<place-holder>.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "<start-line-wrapper-exclusive>" :range-end "<end-line-wrapper-exclusive>"= in the appropriate section in init.org.
   5. Enter =C-x C-s= to save and update =:lines=. (if you don't see the updated effect, run =M-x update-includes= manually)
   6. Call =M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown= to update this README.

* Startup
** Lexical-binding
   Use lexical-binding. [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][Why?]]
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Until Emacs 24.1 (June 2012), Elisp only had dynamically scoped variables, a feature, mostly by accident, common to old lisp dialects. While dynamic scope has some selective uses, it’s widely regarded as a mistake for local variables, and virtually no other languages have adopted it.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :lines "1-2"
** Early Init
   Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before package and UI initialization happens.
*** Defer Garbage Collection
    Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process, according to [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/wiki/FAQ#how-is-dooms-startup-so-fast][hlissner]].
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The GC eats up quite a bit of time, easily doubling startup time. The trick is to turn up the memory threshold as early as possible.
    #+END_QUOTE
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DeferGC" :range-end "-DeferGC"  :lines "46-48"
*** Disable =package-enable-at-startup=
    Package initialize occurs automatically, before =user-init-file= is loaded, but after =early-init-file=.
    We handle package initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetPES" :range-end "-UnsetPES"  :lines "51-52"
*** Unset =file-name-handler-alist=
    Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it won’t need any of them.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetFNHA" :range-end "-UnsetFNHA" :lines "55-57"
*** Disable =site-run-file=
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UnsetSRF" :range-end "-UnsetSRF" :lines "60-61"
*** Disable Unnecessary Interface
    It will be faster to disable them here before they've been initialized.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DisableUnnecessaryInterface" :range-end "-DisableUnnecessaryInterface" :lines "64-68"
** Restore Default After Startup
    A large gc-cons-threshold will cause freezing and stuttering during long-term interactive use.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "RestoreGC" :range-end "-RestoreGC" :lines "51-57"
** Garbage Collect Configuration
*** Garbage Collect When Emacs is Out of Focus
    *Note:* Since Emacs27.1, =focus-out-hook= is obsolete.
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "AutoGC" :range-end "-AutoGC" :lines "60-68"
*** Avoid Garbage Collect When Using Minibuffer
    #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "MinibufferGC" :range-end "-MinibufferGC" :lines "69-78"
** Load-Path
   Since all the configuration files are stored in =elisp/= folder, they need to be added to =load-path= on startup.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "LoadPath" :range-end "-LoadPath"  :lines "81-93"
** Define Constants
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-const.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "Consts" :range-end "-Consts"  :lines "45-89"
* Package Management
  Some packages are disabled with the =:disabled= tag, because I don't use them very often. They might not work.
** Melpa Packages
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "MelpaPackages" :range-end "-MelpaPackages" :lines "41-49"
   Load all Melpa packages in =elisp/= to =load-path= directly to reduce startup time.
** Non-Melpa Packages
   Add packages contained in =site-elisp/= to =load-path= too.

*** Add Packages Manually from Git
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
      cd site-elisp/
      git submodule add https://github.com/foo/bar.git
    #+END_SRC
    Verify =/.gitmodules= file that the newly added package exist.
*** Update Manually Added Packages
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
      git submodule init
      git submodule update
    #+END_SRC
** Configure Package Manager
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "ConfigurePackageManager" :range-end "-ConfigurePackageManager" :lines "52-60"
** Use-Package
   My Emacs configuration is almost entirely dependant on [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The =use-package= macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your .emacs file in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy. I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage. Yet with this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "ConfigureUsePackage" :range-end "-ConfigureUsePackage"  :lines "63-77"
** Auto Package Update
   [[https://github.com/rranelli/auto-package-update.el][Auto package update]] automatically updates installed packages if at least =auto-package-update-interval= days have passed since the last update.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "AutoPackageUpdate" :range-end "-AutoPackageUpdate" :lines "80-87"
** Diminish
   [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/diminish][Diminish]], a feature that removes certain minor modes from mode-line.
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DimPac" :range-end "-DimPac" :lines "90-91"
** GNU Elpa Keyring Update
   [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html][GNU Elpa Keyring Update]], Update Emacs's GPG keyring for GNU ELPA.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The GPG key used to sign the GNU ELPA archives is nearing retirement: it expires this September. Which means that if you don't get the new key before, you won't be able to check the signature of new packages after that date.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-package.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "GNUElpaKeyPac" :range-end "-GNUElpaKeyPac" :lines "94-95"
* Global Functionalities
